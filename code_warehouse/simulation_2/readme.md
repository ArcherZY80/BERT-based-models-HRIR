This is the introduction file for simulation_2 folder

In this folder we will have two subfolder which stands for Iteration1, Iteration2.

Since the following iteration (I3,I4,etc.) prodedure is the same as Iteration2, we don't provide them here.

In each subfolder, there will be two samples showing how we use SimpleTransformer and Transformer library for simulation_2

For each sample, we will have a xx.ipynb file contains the training and classification part and a xxx_val.ipynb file contains the multi-model labeling part.

*One thing should be noticed here if you are performing Iteration3, Iteration4, etc. You should concate all the labeled data made by xxx_val.ipynb. Here in Iteration 2 we only concate one because there is only one iteration before it.

e.g. If you are doing Iteration 3, you should concate the file generated by Iteration1 and the one generate by Iteration 2.
