This is the simple documentation of code files.

Here we have three folders which are:

First simulation folder

Additional training folder

Second simulation folder


In each folder we will have files to show how to reproduce our work with SimpleTransformer Library and the Transformer Library.

We only provide one sample for each library, if you want to use the code file for different model with the same library, the only thing you need to do is to change the model name (and tokenizer name).

You can find the model name in the official document of those libraries and you can also check additional training folder for all the model names we used in this project

The detail of which library is used for certain model can be found in the thesis file in the root folder.
