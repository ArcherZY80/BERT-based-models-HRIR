This is the simple instruction of the simulation_1 folder.

There are two code files in this folder. They are two examples showing how we use SimpleTransformer and Transformer Library in this simluation.

Here we use scibert as an example showing how to use Transformer Library in this simulation.

We use roberta-base as an exampe showing how to use SimpleTransformer Library in this simulation.

We have applied multiple models in this simulation, please refer to the thesis to see which model is implemented with which library.
