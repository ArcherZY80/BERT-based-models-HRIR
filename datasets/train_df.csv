I am writing this as many people I’ve talked to can relate to a lot of people voicing concerns on Piazza, but felt that some people didn’t expand on their points very eloquently (no offense!) and I would just like to share mine and some peers’ general thoughts on the 137 course so far. Also sorry if my wording-word choice is not great, I am not good at forming out my thoughts in words.
This year is especially hard given we have online learning, which just doesn’t work very well for some people (like me) for various reasons such as understanding things clearly written out (maybe not this type of learner), having ADHD or learning disabilities that make things extra hard, having to work in unideal environments, etc. It is also an unprecedented time and the things that can be done by universities are limited and hard for them to determine the best course of action so I do get this aspect of why people are finding the course hard. However, I do have some concerns/personal feedback on this course.

Even people in upper years now admit that the assessments we are doing this year in 137 are a lot harder than they had (ex. on reddit). There is also an instructor who agrees this year is much harder “I took this course myself years ago and found it challenging to adapt from highschool, so I can't even imagine how much harder this is” https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/jkjeeq/math_137/ A large part of this must be the online learning, but I think that there are a few aspects of the course that are really just making it harder for us than necessary. 

I have heard profs say that this year’s marks for the class are in line with past years. I think that the marks are still in line with past years because a good chunk of people are just doing well because of all the opportunities to cheat in a plethora of ways even if it's just slightly cheating, with assessments being online and unsupervised after all. The instructors must've known this and hence increased the difficulty level of quizzes etc. However, this leaves a number of those who wouldn't want to cheat but are unable to keep up with the difficulty of this course or have difficulty learning in an online format, to see low marks. (Or people who just cannot pass without cheating general). This may actually lead to eventual desperation and cheating, making a big loop back to the beginning issue of cheating (where instructors don’t want this year’s grades to all be super high for unfair reasons). While I understand that most classes in any university like to see this nice bell curve and would like scores in each year to be relatively similar, in the end it is unfair to individual students to have to up the difficulty especially given how hard it is for some people to learn at all on an online format. Now this also causes a lot of anxiety, stress, lack of sleep, and overall strain on mental health especially with the already heavy stress of quarantine for some individuals. 

Talking about specifics, I would like to address the following areas that I take issue with. One thing is the very particular wording on mobius quizzes that needs you to read super thoroughly. This makes it very easy to have silly mistakes made by those who actually understand the material but didn’t read closely enough or have many distractions and couldn’t focus on the wording so much. The wording could be especially confusing to international students who already have a hard time understanding different meanings in English and they seem to have a clear unfair disadvantage. Another thing is how we don’t get any part marks and thus need to know every question extremely well which is even worse coupled with sometimes weird wording. I get that this is a hard one to move around, but for courses such as 135 I feel like it has managed to implement part marks very well (also side note, the fact that we don’t know the number of right answers, as ALL of the questions ask you to choose unlimited choices, adds an additional layer of difficulty). During office hours with a prof, he didn’t even know what the some of the questions were asking and was very confused. I think this fact really reflects the issues with the wording as even a prof couldn’t understand it well. A third thing is how we don’t get to know the correct answers on the mobius which doesn’t help us improve for next time and we have to wait for afterwards when we can check the markbook. But by that time, we would have moved onto concepts taught 2 weeks later, and we could lack the fundamental knowledge from earlier which causes a domino effect of struggling to understand. On a smaller scale, sometimes mobius messes up and marks things incorrectly so not seeing the correct answer causes more confusion and self doubt. Another thing is the fact that a lot of the questions are not explained in videos and we need to make all connections ourselves. Much of the content being actually taught is just the theorems, but how to critically solve questions and what to make of the content is completely up to our own understanding. Also the videos are from several years ago which can be perceived by some as lacking care. 

In response to the idea some people are suggesting about increased attempts on mobius, ex. 5 attempts from now on: I myself did see a mark improvement with the 5 attempts, but I don’t think my actual understanding of information changed much, I just learned what not to choose next time. So, I don’t believe making 5 attempts is a great idea no matter how much I personally would like this, because it doesn’t address the real issue of how many students are struggling to understand the content with the current teaching methods/course structure. I also disagree with people who want to change the overall weighting of the 2 parts of the midterm. I think this would be very unfair as the weights have been set at the beginning of the year and some people actually did well on sections the majority did not. If anything, the difficulty of *future* things could be decreased or we could be given more bonus assignment, etc (I will not speak on my suggestions as the profs know more about what is realistic or actually possible to implement). 

Another thing I won’t address too much as to not spread any rumours based on speculation, is the 225% overacceptance. My personal belief is that the difficulty has also been upped in order to trim down this number, and historically it does make sense. A 225% overaccepted math faculty occurred as they expected many people to defer their acceptance due to covid concerns, but made a big error leading to the overacceptance rate. I cannot speak on any of the 14x courses, but I think that my hypothesis isn’t really applicable for those courses in the first place as those who are less strong with math would choose 13x courses opposed to those who have done the Euclid and proved that they can handle 14x, and by extension, “deserve to at UW”. So 13x courses would be an obvious course to try to use to slim down the population. For example, this course is hard, CS135 is a lot of work, and even 135 started getting a lot harder perhaps because we were all doing really well at the beginning (seen on the mark distributions). This overacceptance rate is certainly frustrating for everyone and must be a very hard issue to deal with for the school, but it is equally frustrating to be given much greater expectations than previous years because of the need to thin down the population. I get this is how universities operate but it is unfair nonetheless that we didn’t contribute to the overacceptance and especially for those who won’t “make the cut” and have to deal with the extra disappointment of failing their requirements (I, for one, would certainly rather not be accepted than come only to waste my time and effort then fail). Again, not saying this is the truth in any way, just my opinion of this year’s difficulty level.

Addressing the midterm specifically because I didn’t see as many people voicing concerns until the midterm: This part is only going to be my personal opinion. I think the mobius parts had the same level of difficulty as normal quizzes, but all mobius quizzes are flawed in my opinion, and the midterm simply really reflected this unfairness. The crowdmark part was certainly harder for me, because of how we didn’t do anything too similar to it before, and it was harder than the crowdmark questions for the past few weeks. Just from my own performance on it.

Finally, I want to say that I do understand this is a very unique time and determining the right way to do anything is extremely difficult especially for profs, I am in no way trying to complain or blame anyone, however I do think this is a struggle for many students that I would like to bring to light with a more thorough explanation. I know that the profs are trying their best in this hard time, and they do care about us. I want to say a big thank you to all the instructors who have to deal with figuring everything out and also monitoring piazza so closely (it’s really awesome, I got a reply at 3am yesterday) and I really appreciate this. Also, there are undoubtedly students who are just able to get very good marks in this course (I will not pretend like everyone is struggling) and I am in no way trying to minimize your effort, good job for those who are doing well! 

Please stay strong and hopeful everyone, I believe in you! And a gentle reminder to please be nice to your fellow students on piazza, we are all trying our best!",1.0

4,they think i wouldnt be able to handle the stress in UBC or other canadian universities. i am an international student and they want me to persue technical fields in the defence sector or do engineering in my country. They keep saying we dont want to spend a lot of money on your education if you're gonna drop out and are fixated on the idea that only non serious people go to canada to study in diploma courses and earn money while doing part time jobs. I want to do a graduation 4 year course in UBC as it is my top choice. So please tell me how hard is it to be an university student in UBC doing graduation in Computer Science.

5,"I am an international student and i started enrolling in courses today. Yes i know, it was very late but i had no idea about this until today. I am fucking livid right now. Who was supposed to tell me how to navigate this entire landscape of course enrolment, FCEs and credits. I didn’t have a single clue about any of these fucking things. There was no guidance session about course enrolment, where to look up programs and shit. I basically had to figure out everything on my own, got bits of information from the times the registrar’s office picked up my call and i had to juggle all this with my work as well which was hectic but anyway i am bitching at this point. 

I am just so fucking stressed out right now. I have no idea how this is going to impact my four year degree plan. Now i am on the waitlist for 2 courses and i have a shitload of timetable clashes with the courses i am on the waitlist for. Can somebody please calm me down and explain me to me what kind of ramifications i should brace myself for due to this fuck up? How will it affect me in the long run? And i am totally fucked or not?",1.0
6,"I finished all of my own finals in the first half of the fourth academic year. When I am at home and consider about my own future path after graduation, i feel very pessimistic about my own future.

I do not have a good GPA and am struggling in U of T, and feel very inferior to other peer students in the same program. I don't know what exactly happens to me but I still cannot get a satisfying grade, and this kind of reality makes me feel mentally stressed alongside with the loneliness, anxiety and depression. At the same time, I begin to feel extremely stressful, depressed and anxious from time to time since the second year. Third year is the tough year to me because I failed one course and had to drop one when i got a bad grade in the midterm. At the same time, i need to maintain the full-time student status as an international student, and I made a fault to keep the credits by committing the academic offence, waiting for the ultimate sanction from the academic tribunal. 

I am not saying I am innocent but I do feel that I cannot always be the person that can perform excellently in the academic realm. That feeling of frustration always makes me feel that i am just a useless person and pure loser in this world. I consistently feel very lonely and I don't have a person that I can really talk to, as my parents do not have a good relationship with me, and my parents cannot understand what I am talking about when I tried to communicate with them. After that, I always got into the mood of depression. Over those years, I did not make friends in the campus and I was always busy with a lot of stuff. 

When i am studying in U of T, the mental health issues become severe and critical problems to me when I always feel very depressed, sad and frustrated and lonely from time to time. When it comes to the fact that I am going to graduate in the future, I don't see myself in a positive place in job market or something when I cannot have a nice GPA or good performance in grades, be more competitive than other u of t peers. At the same time, I do not have a nice life here neither when I did not make friends or have somebody that I can share with my own feelings.

At the same time, I tried to apply for positions but all of my applications received any positive replies. Well, I sometimes looked at other people's posts about their own new positions in LinkedIn. From time to time, I see other U of T kids successfully started their own career paths while i am unknown about future. 

I am just feeling emotionally down and getting trapped by the feeling that nobody can really understand me. Maybe others can enjoy the success in academic fields, job markets and relationships etc, they all look like they have the promising futures waiting for them. I ALWAYS DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF MY OWN EXISTENCE IN THE WORLD. I SOMETIMES HAVE THE THOUGHT TO END MY LIFE OR JUST COMMIT SUICIDE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THIS DARK WORLD. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LIFE OR NEXT DECADES WILL LOOK LIKE TO ME.",1.0

The week before the final everything fell apart, i was very stressed and sick. I emailed my professor to explained him my situation and told me talk to my advisors. 3 days before the exam, i got very sick, i had high fever and cold and decided to get checked for COVID and then i tested postive. My doctor told me that i am in no position to take my exam and i should be in complete quarantine and at rest. But as i am an international student, i paid nearly 3k in fees for the course so decided to take the exam in all my suffering while i was super unprepared for it. Yesterday i got my grade and I got a C-. I am extremely scared now that I'll be now required to withdraw for my program. I emailed my professor and explained me everything and he said there's nothing he can do to help me.

9,"I don’t know why but I miss home so much. I’m almost 20 now, it’s been four years but I’m not getting any better. I’m an international student and I’ve been in Victoria since grade 11. Anything that even slightly reminds me of home makes me feel so sad and I just want to hide and cry. I feel the worst at night before I sleep. I usually FaceTime my parents before bed and I just start to tear up whenever they mention the smallest things that used to be part of my life when I was home and it just hurts so much to even think about those days when I was surrounded by friends and family. I hate myself for feeling this way but I just want to be a child again and let my parents take care of me. I know I need to grow up and be responsible for my own decisions like most people my age do. And I’ve been doing great in terms of taking care of myself physically and managing money etc, I eat healthy I love cooking I workout and I don’t splurge on unnecessary things. But I just can’t get rid of that feeling of wanting to be taken care of again and I just miss being home so much. I can’t tell my parents how much I miss them because they will just get really worried and want me to go home. It’s hard to talk to my friends because they just don’t feel the same way. Some days I feel better and I don’t think about this as much but some days I just can’t stop the pain and I just feel like I’ll never be happy again. This week I feel particularly bad because Chinese new year is only 2 days away and all I can think about is how miserable I am not being home for new year for the fourth year when everyone else is home with their parents. This used to be my favorite time of the year, but now I’m not even in the picture anymore and I won’t be for at least another two years if I do actually manage to graduate in two years. I feel like I’m missing out on everything that I used to love and everything that makes me happy in life. I feel better when I’m busy with school and exams and those feeling would go away for a while but it comes back when the exams are over. I can’t go home, it never makes me feel better because I’m constantly reminding myself of the fact that there’s an end to this there’s a date when I need to leave again and be on my own, whenever I go home for a week or two weeks then come back things just get even worse for the next couple of weeks. The homesickness I feel just gets insane and I wouldn’t leave the house for weeks. I would skip all my classes and end up with so much stress during exam seasons and get really bad grades. I really don’t know how to get rid of this feeling I don’t want to be sad and exhausted all the time, I don’t want to keep feeling sorry for myself and get triggered by the smallest things then hide in the washroom and cry. I feel like I’ve been just living in the past for the last four years, I’m constantly looking at old photos and videos, rewatching shows and reading books that I used to love in middle school and I feel like I’m just doing those things to pretend as if I’m still home. Everyone else I know are just moving on with their lives and being in the present and I want to be able to do that too. I can’t live like this anymore but I don’t know what to do",1.0

13,"Going into my 3A term of CS. I had no relevant experience in CS before coming to university. I really enjoy math and do well in it. I studied basic concepts of programming before my first year and I found that I was able to understand it quite well. Since I love math and CS is very related to math, I decided to pursue CS. And I chose Waterloo because of coop. I’m an international student. My communication skills aren’t very good and I’m a bit shy as well. At university I would classify myself as an average student. Even though I work hard for my exams, most of the times I manage to score in the averages. I had to find a coop after my 1B term. I got an interview in the main even though I did not have any relevant work experience, nor did I have any good side projects. Due to my bad communication skills I screwed up the two interviews I got for my first coop. I got nervous and awkward during my interviews. In the end I worked for an early stage startup which was an unpaid coop. I got really good experience from there. After that coop I thought I should improve my skills in tech more. I used to get so drained out during the study terms that I did not to any additional learning to improve my skills to get a job. So I thought I would do it during the breaks that we get between terms. But since I was so exhausted after each term and stressed, I had zero motivation to anything to improve my skills. I usually fly back home and relax with my family and that feels so good. For my second coop job search I prepared before and was more confident. But even after that I was not getting offers. I got an offer very late into the term. All my friends got a job before me. During my second coop, I had to learn everything from scratch, and I always needed help with everything that my employer assigned me. I felt bad that I had to ask so many questions. I felt that what help am I even providing them. I thought that they must think that they could have done that work themselves faster. So I stopped asking a lot of questions after sometime and tried to find answers on my own. I was able to find the answers but that just so much more time to do. Because I’m shy and not a good communicator, I struggled with presenting what I did, even though I got the work done. At the end of my coop, my employer gave me a very good rating. He told me that I should have exuded more confidence and not hesitated to ask for help. I will try my best to learn this lesson  and apply it in my next coop.

I know all this is because I made zero effort to improve my skills. But I just don’t get the motivation to do anything additional, the university itself is too much for me. I’m also average at algorithms. I did not really enjoy cs 240. I feel so sad. I want to make my parents proud. I’m from a middle class family and I have to depend on my parents to pay my tuition. My parents are very understanding. But when I look at other people accomplishing so much and making their parents proud, I feel sad and think that I’m just wasting my parents money.

both my parents lived and worked in montreal, and my siblings grew up here, but none of them know french. so, i assumed i would be ok without any french. was i wrong? yes. i disregarded the fact that to get literally any job, you have to be bilingual. i know work study is a thing, but i didn’t get approved. and i know what you’re thinking, ‘just learn french’. and i have, for 9 years, but i cannot understand it - at all - when it is spoken to me. so there goes many opportunities. 

ii) mcgill’s priority on research
emphasis on research = underemphasis on teaching. the range of courses and scheduling is really limited. hardly any summer courses. also? there aren’t any fun courses. i went to university hoping to at least take an interesting, stereotypical college course like ‘western films’ or ‘famous crimes’. i just find it funny that our ‘bird courses’ are physics and chemistry courses, which i already spend all my time taking. and on the topic of research, funding for students (aside from national grants) is nonexistent. even getting a position is difficult, there is no assistance whatsoever.

iii) living off campus 
i didn’t realize how much of a difference it makes living in the ghetto vs anywhere else. people act as if you live in another city entirely and don’t want to make the effort to see you. where i’m from, commuting was the norm.

iv) coming from alberta 
one of the main reasons i chose mcgill was because of the international student body. i was hoping to do a year abroad, but that dream was quickly gone once i realized i wanted to finish my degree as soon as possible. i don’t feel like i belong to any of the international communities here, i’m just from alberta. i know lots of people who have a community just because they all come from a certain country. and now that montreal is my permanent residence, as my parent was transferred here for work, i can no longer go back home and attend uni there. and lastly, montreal is a major change for me, so many more people, so cramped. i knew this beforehand, i just didn’t know how anxiety inducing it would be for me.

the reason i’m saying all of this is because i’ve stayed in contact with my friends from home, and their experiences just seem so much more fulfilling. plenty of jobs to apply for, advising for anything, fun courses,  and a generally better community. i can’t imagine how i’ll get a reference letter from anyone with inaccessible profs and no job opportunities.",0.0
21,"I need help.

I'm lying in bed with a knife and all i want to do is end it all. I've fucked up every opportunity I had and pushed away everyone. I don't know what to do I don't know who to reach out for help anymore. I have tried to reach out for help and nothing. Nothing gets better, I just end up feeling like shit again. I'm an international student and I haven't talked to my family for a while. My mom for month my brother for years. I have no support, nothing. No future anymore. I can't see the light anymore I want to be able to climb out of this hole but I keep calling deeper. I'm in debt and can't pay my tuition fees which means I can't stay here anymore. The though of going back ""home"" fills me with dread and I'd rather end it all than go back there. There is nothing for me there, just people who don't care about me and people who have abandoned me. I came here to escape my family and I fucked it up and won't be allowed to stay here anymore. I'm not a citizen, I don't know will help me anymore I don't know who to ask for help. My mom's answer to my depression was what do you have to be depressed about you wanted to go to Canada. I don't want to go back, I can't go back I'd rather die. I don't know who to turn to for help. I've contacted the school and they couldn't help me. I'm taking medication and that didn't help. I try to go out and exercise aand live healthily and that doesn't help. I just wanna die I'm scared of the pain but I just want it to be over. I can't see things getting better I just can't. I hate myself. I've lost myself I'm a weak shell of who I used to be. I used to be good and like to help people and be there for my friends no matter what and now I'm not that person anymore.

22,"Okay basically I’m fucked up and I think my mental health is really SCREWED UP.
I’m an international student who was supposed to go back this summer and then this whole situation happened. First of all I got a house, a reasonable house nothing fancy, sort of clean and seemed nice when I was getting it with my friends. God knows how many nicer rooms and apartments there were but we eventually settled for this house cause I thought getting it with my friends and having my emotional support was worth it and honestly wanted to get it over with  because I had so many midterms at the time and wanted the process to be done and thought whatever it is I can deal with it if my friends are here. THEN this whole Covid-19 happened and my friends who were international students too went back and basically now I’m the only one in the house. Left here for God knows how many more months. I can go back but I’m scared I won’t be able to come to Canada when everything is reopened for winter sem (hopefully)and also because it’s really BAD in my country. So basically I’ve been stressed out for months now With absolutely no idea what to do. 
Today one of my house mates came back and she THROWS A PARTY with loud music and screaming going on for the whole day, then one of the other housemates says oh in winter there is always rats in the house which scares the hell out of me because how am I supposed to take care of that??????????
Well I’m all over the place I’ve drawn myself and my parents to insanity because I don’t know what to do. Go back? Stay and deal with this shit? Change my place and go to a nicer apartment? I seriously have no idea what to do. This Situation really messed me up. In addition I’m such a studious person and I’m like 100% introvert so I can’t deal with loud people or parties at all and even though i don’t have anything to study for now I’m scared if the situation goes on and with libraries closed what am I gonna do when fall sem begins?

23,"As the title says, I'm so done with everything, for the past couple of days I have been doing nothing other than fighting with my family for what I am going through, I am so mentally stressed and this has never been who I am. I understand that Uni is different than high school but as a person who never got less than 97% on physics and I end up with a 50% on this midterm, I can't accept that and can't do anything about that too. Why do you give a test that is one hour full of tricky question that need to be read more than once? I don't want to accept the idea that I am not good enough for this program but still I can't stay until 8 am in the morning crying in my bed feeling hopeless watching everything I dreamt of fading away. Why can't the test be at the level of an average student, I think about international students whose first language is not English and how they would have hard time understanding the tricky wording of some questions. I feel so week watching many manage full time jobs, study and many other things and are successful too, how do you do that? I left aside all the personal problems that I am going through in order to get good grades and when I say personal problems I mean that I have so much in my life that is enough to break me to pieces. Example? I am forced to study in this weather with no heaters literally freezing cause my landlord is trying to save money ( no advice would help on this since I tried everything already) Why can't the tests have content that was actually taught?

24,"Hey so I'm probably applying to UofT for the fall of 2021 and as an international student I was wondering how much money it would cost me to pay for tuition + living expenses during my first year. Idk if this matters but I plan on majoring in political science.

On another note, I was also wondering if I'll be able to get in. During my first 2 years of high school i struggled a lot w depression and anxiety and that inevitably reflected on my grades. i ended up having to do credit recovery for 3 classes (still doing it). on top of that, my school doesn't really offer any extracurriculars like at all and i cant rly do anything in my city. This year i managed to have really good grades (a B average) and i plan to do the same next year. will those grades + a good ACT score be enough?

25,"I literally don't know what I am doing wrong. Just 2 years ago with only a crappy internship, I was getting 1 internship interview (for software engineering/development) per 7 applications that include companies like Hootsuite, Onatario Power Generation, Nokia etc. Fast forward 2 years my gpa has improved significantly (I missed dean's honor list because of 26 credits instead of 27 credit but had 84 average, this year I feel like it will go up by a lot)  a decent 8 month internship (that makes me to have in total 10 months internship), several good personal project and I am not getting interviews both for intern and new grad at all. I have applied to big companies as well as small local startups and the story is more or less the same. I got my resume reviewed by 12 people and they all say my resume is really good and I personally feel I am a much better candidate then that of 2 years ago. 

At this stage I am regretting everything, even coming to UBC. Computer Engineering for me was a very difficult degree and as an international student both my family and I had to make a lot of sacrifices (my relationship with my family has degraded a lot that both of us feel even though we don't admit as I rarely have time to talk with them), my health has deteriorated a lot (I am overweight and don't have much time to exercise due to leetcode grinding and ensuring a good gpa) and all of my life I only know study and study. I am feeling extremely useless and feeling like I have wasted my entire life. What's the point of all this hard work if I can't even have a single interview, let alone a job?

I am getting too far into depression and having suicidal thoughts, I can't just take any more rejects and or ghosting. I have seen even this year people with less experience, even sophomore are getting interviews while I am being ghosted and/or rejected left and right. I really need help at this stage and I don't know where to start. The online school makes it even worse as I have more assignments and almost no seeing/talking with familiar faces.

28,"hello, so i’m an international student from pakistan  &amp; like a lot of other students, booked a room because i fully intended on coming in September. basically here’s the story, i had to to pass a credibility interview as it was one of the conditions in my conditional offer, for some reason, uni took ages and i had my interview in the middle of September, and also to pass that interview i had to provide university with an accommodation address and letting them know where i’ve arranged my stay at and only after passing that interview, i would be issued a CAS statement.

i passed the interview and due to everyone constantly telling me took book an accommodation, that the rooms will fill up quickly and because accommodation details for my Visa file were needed and for the credibility interview as well . i booked a room with student roost st davids.

so this is where the problem started. i knew they were going to charge me for September and october and it was about £1000. i was fine with paying that amount because i had no other choice because i thought i’d get my visa in october &amp; then i’ll fly out to the uk but around mid  october i got an email from UKVI that my pre departure TB test was expired and that i would have to provide them with a new one, this is where the shit show started. i contacted IOM, the people who conduct the tb tests and they told me that they required my passport in order to book me a test, there was literally no way of getting my passport back without having my visa application rejected but they did give me a few weeks time to provide them with a new test but they literally didn’t tell me what i had to do in order to get my passport back for the test so after weeks of emails to UKVI and going to a lot of offices i finally managed to get ukvi to send an official copy of my passport, to IOM the testing hospital thing, i booked a new test and finally got my visa in mid november. at this point i contacted student roost and asked them if they could cancel my tenancy because we only had online classes. and even tho they had a visa break clause but they said that i had to tell them before my visa got rejected but what was i supposed to tell them? my visa never got rejected it just took a lot longer to process. nothing in my control. so they asked for a bunch of proof and then basically refused and said that i still had to pay for the entire year.

at first we were promised face to face and online lectures, but uni first changed that to online lectures/ face to face seminars, and then towards the end online only lectures. so it wasn’t ideal for me to move and i decided to fly to the uk for my next semester. so i explained to them my situation. most of the time i felt like as if automated bots replied to my email but every time an actual person did they just wanted money and refused. so i decided to get a tickets for december 30 right when my end of semester exams  ended so i could make ends meet and pay for my arrears that are upto (£2000) and also actually go live at my room.

here comes december  and my country imposes a travel ban on the uk because of the new covid variant, i have a few family friends in  the uk and they told my family to not let me
come as the situation had gotten really bad, one of them works for the NHS covid ward and he said that people were dying and that it was absolutely unideal to come, so i contacted student roost again. they ask for proof of me studying my second semester online as well. i ask uni to write an official statement and sent it to student roost &amp; same thing, that your rooms still available for you to use so find a replacement tenet or blah blah. mind you, i’ve been looking at facebook forums for replacement tenets but everyone on facebook is looking for replacement tenets to get out of contracts because it’s that bad. they ask for so much proof only to refuse so, within the first 2 weeks of january. uni issued an email advising students to “
please not travel back to campus “ unless it’s an essential course that requires lab work, “ so our courses are shifted to online only until basically last week of feb and the semester ends in april. student roost said they’d be waving off a few weeks rent off of students because of the new lockdown but that wouldn’t apply to students who had arrears and that means that i don’t qualify for that.
i’ve already decided to switch unis after 1st year and have looked into a few unis in canada  that would accept me because and i have a lot of family there &amp; of how awful my first year experience have been.

now i’m aware that we, international students have to show our finances and i did but due to some personal problems i really can’t afford to pay them for a room that  was never even assigned to me, i don’t know where my flat is located in the building or who my roommates are. they said they only assign rooms when the tenant arrives at the property. so they continue to send me emails. for the first time in my life, i’ve had severe anxiety and depression because they continue to antagonise me.

i had no option left so i contacted a family friend who happens to own a few law firms based in the uk and im going to be looking into whatever my options are with him, i also got an email from student roost saying that they’d contact my guarantor but they never asked me for one?? i never provided them with any details or made any deposits. so i’m aware of the legal repercussions but honestly i’m in a situation where i can’t afford to pay for a room i’ve never done seen before. i haven’t even been to the uk before and i don’t want to be involved  into any legal issues.

when i started looking into student roost, it turns out that they are just an evil company who have profited off of students this year and they also do sketchy shit. someone accused them of changing their policies that were already in place, they are famous for milking money out of a student by any means. they are also known for posting false positive reviews about themselves on the internet so i’m really trapped right now.

the fact that this is happening to students in the middle of a pandemic like if there weren’t any travel bans or lockdowns. i would have obviously come. i was so excited for uni but this has been by far the biggest regret and the worst experience i’ve gone through. i’m literally brought down to an all time low because of this so, does anyone got any advice, it’ll be very appreciated,",0.0

31,"I applied for a leave at an art school in NS last year. I went to high school in NS, and I was an international student and my major was Design. I finished my 2nd year and left with 2 years left.

Reason for leave was high tuition as an international student, and even though some classes were great some were a $6000 joke. I wasn't eligible for a student loan and my parents were helping me with tuition but there wasn't enough money for me to graduate. we also had issues with our landlord due to pests in the building, and it made it really difficult to get a lease on a new place.

I moved to Ontario with my husband and we live with his dad. It's a living situation that causes us a lot of stress and we'd like to move out. I think the best thing would be to find a school and relocate, and sign a lease in that area.

Currently we are outside of the country but we return end of August // beginning of September. Neither of us is employed. I am a permanent resident now, and my husband is a Canadian citizen. We are considering going back to school, especially now that I can apply for student loans.

As much as I am interested in arts &amp; music, with everything I've gone through in the past year I told myself that if I went back to school it would be for something practical. I'm considering Interactive Design since it's something I am interested in, and on the practical end of Design stuff. Hubby and I make music and I have considered studying music at Uni, but I'd like to study something I'd be able to get a job with relative ease at the end of the program. A friend from US recommended nursing, stating that you can do well financially working 3 days a week, but I don't think that's the case in Canada. It seems to be hard work for not a lot of money.

I think it would be beneficial for us to go to a school in Ontario, taking advantage of OSAP. Just not sure what to study yet. I'm open to suggestions. It would be for the 2021 year since it's too late for this year plus all the covid stuff.",0.0

sorry for this kinda lengthy post amidst Mildly Stress Season but i'm really interested to garner opinions after lurking on this sub for weeks :p

i'm an 18 years old international student (singapore), expected to take my a levels (singapore-cambridge a levels) in november and applying for the fall 2021 intake. i really do appreciate every single comment and thank you so much for your time!!!!

a little context on how i got to know of uoft:
frankly, just a few weeks prior, where i was notified that my college nominated me for the lester b pearson scholarship, and i thought it was an excellent opportunity, so i took it and have already submitted my application under ouac 105 (a week and a half ago and i still haven't received my joinid but i heard it takes up to 2-3 weeks to process applications, should i be concerned at this moment?)

i'm extremely interested in pursuing a major in history, particularly a joint specialist in history and pol. science. my choices were uoft sg - history, uoft m - history, uoft s - journalism. my academic profile isn't too shabby and my extra-curriculars are pretty beefed up as well, so with regards to admissions i'm not too worried (though one can never be too complacent)

1. does uoft required predicted grades? i'm receiving my actual grades in end february 2021 and have already applied to other UK schools with my predicteds, so i was just wondering whether uoft accepts admissions based off predicteds

2. are my choices recommended? i'm extremely passionate in history and aspire to be an educator post-grad, can any current students majoring in the arts offer me insights into uoft's humanities department?

3. i'm aware uoft's curriculum is rigorous, but i'm curious on current students' opinions of uoft's international rankings. i'm planning on applying to the national university of singapore and yale-nus (and uk schools as well) and was wondering whether it would be advisable to reject offers from them to attend uoft

4. will uoft still offer the international scholars award if i fail to get the lester b pearson scholarship?

5. will remote learning be the only option should i enter in fall of 2021?

6. any and every opinions are welcomed!!!

also if there's any current singaporeans studying at uoft, please feel free to drop me a message if you don't mind!!!",0.0

41,Hi all! I’m a graduate Econ student. I completely failed one course this term that can end up with 10% as final grade.

42,"Hello everyone.

Recently I have been having a really hard time trying to cope up with mental health issues and the academic pressure at the same time and I’m about to lose my mind if I have not already. I’m a U1 international student who did IB in highschool and graduated with a high GPA and all my life I was able to study and motivate myself even through the most stressful and painful times. I remember taking a university exam the day after my cousin was murdered without even being able to take a break and think through what was happening because all there was to me and to my life was academic success and I HAD to go on. 
Now, in my second semester at McGill I can easily say that I’m depressed and cannot find a single way to motivate myself not just to study but to go on enjoying the most basic needs and pleasures of life. I was put on academic probation last semester and I promised myself that this semester would be different and I motivated myself, getting pretty good grades from my first midterms. I even got a B+ from a considerably difficult course and I was happy I could get a payback from the hard work I put in. I was “happy” and motivated for a small interval of time.
But two weeks ago just before the break I lost a high school friend out of a tragic death and had a panick attack for the first time in my life, which made me go through a week of constant stress and anxiety all of a sudden without being able to sleep, eat, think calmly. I swear every night I would go to bed scared, only being able to sleep after half an hour of breathing exercises. I couldn’t get professional help after the attack for 3 full days because the hub was closed and I went to the ER of the closest hospital only to wait there for 3 hours at midnight without getting to see a doctor.
I returned to my country for the break thinking spending some time with my family (doctors, I opened up to them about the situation and they totally support me &amp; my academic decisions in any case) would help but honestly I’m even more stressed thinking about the upcoming exams and assignments on next week, I have to catch up with the material of the classes I missed from that week of crisis where I couldn’t go to any of the lectures.
I just really feel like taking a break from academics for my mental health and I’m 100% sure this is the right thing to do because otherwise I don’t know if I can find a motivation to get myself out of this state of constant depression and stress. I can’t fool myself anymore thinking I can just “study and do better” in this constant uncertainty I’m going through.
I read online that in order to take a break from studies you have to either withdraw from the university studies or take a leave of absence. I want to be able to continue with my studies some time in the future, probably next fall but I’m not sure what to do since I was put on interim probation last semester, and really afraid that I won’t be permitted to take a leave of absence because of my standing. Can I even take a leave in the middle of the semester? I’m confused. Please help me see my options....

Thanks in advance.",0.0

Sadly, I often ignored the emails sent by Ana when I'm anxious/stressed/depressed or just really struggling in the semesters.

Like if this wasn't enough stress to cope with, I started searching some masters to continue my study course, and I found the MSc in Plant Science, offered by LFC in UBC. After quickly checking this sub and acknowledge that LFS is a really small faculty (I've read some ""when I say I'm from LFS they don't even understand that's a faculty in UBC"", lmao), I started gathering some more infos on both UBC and LFS. I found out that, for this particular MSc, and as an international student, I will be funded at least $16k/year, so I'd call that a proper scholarship lol (in Italy I receive a 3.2k euros / year funding). Let's arrive to the main point: as an international student, I obviously need a place where to sleep, and I don't really have no contacts in Canada / Vancouver to understand the rent situation. I searched for UBC residences, and I found the studios in Marine Drive residences. The studios seem quite nice and the price is kind of honest, related to university residences here in Milan (where I'm currently studying). 
Can someone tell me their experience in this residence? Maybe add some pros and cons too, don't go too soft on them cause I need a ""raw"" description. More in general, is it better to rent a UBC residence or it's fine living outside UBC too? Concluding, any tips for a helpless Italian boy?

52,"Greetings r4r people... I have never thought that I would need to post here, but after staying at home alone for way too many months I find out that I have to exercise my very rusty social skills beyond conversing with my villagers in Animal Crossing. I am looking for a spark (or an explosion), mischievous banters, and eventually might open up to meeting up local people and frolick under the sun.

I am a third culture kid. Born and raised in SE Asia, spent 10 years as an international student in SF Bay Area, and drove with most important possessions across the border to Canada to escape Donald Trump's tyrannous Americans first policy (boohoo). I have a graduate degree and currently am working in a university. Despite working as a professional in a very nerdy field, I actually have very little nerdy interests so don't expect me to talk nerdy to you about LOTR/GoT/Star Wars/Star Trek/other fandoms. My interests are more in celebrity fashion, food, and social causes. I have won a RuPaul's drag race trivia before, so that should give you an impression that I do have a freaky whimsical side despite acting like a heartless robot most days.

I am proud to announce that I think (can't diagnose myself) I am mostly depression free after living a pretty miserable life for 3 years. I am currently in the process of slowly rebuilding my life - be good at my job (check), lose some belly fat (check) and be an interesting person by staying true to myself and rediscover my interests (check). Now that I am somewhat whole again, I think it's a good time for me to find a partner in crime to explore Toronto and the Ontario wilderness when the lockdown ends. I am interested in travel and languages, but since I have a developing country passport I view travel as a privilege a lot of you North Americans are not aware of and are rather gauchely displaying (or I'm just bitter).

Some lighthearted conversation prompts:
1) Where do you want to travel to when the lockdown ends, and why?
2) What kind of live music shows do you enjoy?
3) What blogs/sites do you frequent on the internet other than Reddit?
4) Who are your favorite petstagram accounts?

I am looking for men who are preferrably slightly older than me (like early 30s). I skipped grades when I was younger and have older friends, so I'd like to think that I am pretty mature and would like to have age-appropriate company. I'd like to meet someone confident and equally sophisticated and silly - normally I can tell this from body language/facial expression. Someone who washes their hands regularly with soap and warm water for 20 seconds, owns at least one face covering, and not believe Covid hoax articles. Despite my self deprecating talk, I am a pretty successful overachiever and while I don't require you to be a startup founder or something, it will be nice to meet some kind of professional person who are good at their job. Lastly, your pic gets mine. Thank you for reading!

54,"LONG POST

hello, so i’m an international student from pakistan  &amp; like a lot of other students, booked a room because i fully intended on coming in September. basically here’s the story, i had to to pass a credibility interview as it was one of the conditions in my conditional offer, for some reason, uni took ages and i had my interview in the middle of September, and also to pass that interview i had to provide university with an accommodation address and letting them know where i’ve arranged my stay at and only after passing that interview, i would be issued a CAS statement.

i passed the interview and due to everyone constantly telling me took book an accommodation, that the rooms will fill up quickly and because accommodation details for my Visa file were needed and for the credibility interview as well . i booked a room with student roost st davids. 

so this is where the problem started. i knew they were going to charge me for September and october and it was about £1000. i was fine with paying that amount because i had no other choice because i thought i’d get my visa in october &amp; then i’ll fly out to the uk but around mid  october i got an email from UKVI that my pre departure TB test was expired and that i would have to provide them with a new one, this is where the shit show started. i contacted IOM, the people who conduct the tb tests and they told me that they required my passport in order to book me a test, there was literally no way of getting my passport back without having my visa application rejected but they did give me a few weeks time to provide them with a new test but they literally didn’t tell me what i had to do in order to get my passport back for the test so after weeks of emails to UKVI and going to a lot of offices i finally managed to get ukvi to send an official copy of my passport, to IOM the testing hospital thing, i booked a new test and finally got my visa in mid november. at this point i contacted student roost and asked them if they could cancel my tenancy because we only had online classes. and even tho they had a visa break clause but they said that i had to tell them before my visa got rejected but what was i supposed to tell them? my visa never got rejected it just took a lot longer to process. nothing in my control. so they asked for a bunch of proof and then basically refused and said that i still had to pay for the entire year. 

at first we were promised face to face and online lectures, but uni first changed that to online lectures/ face to face seminars, and then towards the end online only lectures. so it wasn’t ideal for me to move and i decided to fly to the uk for my next semester. so i explained to them my situation. most of the time i felt like as if automated bots replied to my email but every time an actual person did they just wanted money and refused. so i decided to get a tickets for december 30 right when my end of semester exams  ended so i could make ends meet and pay for my arrears that are upto (£2000) and also actually go live at my room. 

here comes december  and my country imposes a travel ban on the uk because of the new covid variant, i have a few family friends in  the uk and they told my family to not let me
come as the situation had gotten really bad, one of them works for the NHS covid ward and he said that people were dying and that it was absolutely unideal to come, so i contacted student roost again. they ask for proof of me studying my second semester online as well. i ask uni to write an official statement and sent it to student roost &amp; same thing, that your rooms still available for you to use so find a replacement tenet or blah blah. mind you, i’ve been looking at facebook forums for replacement tenets but everyone on facebook is looking for replacement tenets to get out of contracts because it’s that bad. they ask for so much proof only to refuse so, within the first 2 weeks of january. uni issued an email advising students to “
please not travel back to campus “ unless it’s an essential course that requires lab work, “ so our courses are shifted to online only until basically last week of feb and the semester ends in april. student roost said they’d be waving off a few weeks rent off of students because of the new lockdown but that wouldn’t apply to students who had arrears and that means that i don’t qualify for that. 
i’ve already decided to switch unis after 1st year and have looked into a few unis in canada  that would accept me because and i have a lot of family there &amp; of how awful my first year experience have been. 

now i’m aware that we, international students have to show our finances and i did but due to some personal problems i really can’t afford to pay them for a room that  was never even assigned to me, i don’t know where my flat is located in the building or who my roommates are. they said they only assign rooms when the tenant arrives at the property. so they continue to send me emails. for the first time in my life, i’ve had severe anxiety and depression because they continue to antagonise me. 

i had no option left so i contacted a family friend who happens to own a few law firms based in the uk and im going to be looking into whatever my options are with him, i also got an email from student roost saying that they’d contact my guarantor but they never asked me for one?? i never provided them with any details or made any deposits. so i’m aware of the legal repercussions but honestly i’m in a situation where i can’t afford to pay for a room i’ve never done seen before. i haven’t even been to the uk before and i don’t want to be involved  into any legal issues. 

when i started looking into student roost, it turns out that they are just an evil company who have profited off of students this year and they also do sketchy shit. someone accused them of changing their policies that were already in place, they are famous for milking money out of a student by any means. they are also known for posting false positive reviews about themselves on the internet so i’m really trapped right now. 

the fact that this is happening to students in the middle of a pandemic like if there weren’t any travel bans or lockdowns. i would have obviously come. i was so excited for uni but this has been by far the biggest regret and the worst experience i’ve gone through. i’m literally brought down to an all time low because of this so has anyone faced this issue ? and does anyone got any advice, it’ll be very appreciated,",0.0

60,"This might end up being a long one idk. 

School for me, just like for everyone, is a major point of stress in my life. But not for the same reasons as most. For the longest time, I've struggled with extremely low self-esteem. In grade school, I was always top of my class only to move on from there and start flunking. Of course, it didn't help that I was also the fat kid and didn't really do much else. Cue the teasing and ""jokes"". I slowly internalized all of this and ended up seeing myself as a regular at the bottom. The ironic part is that I've been told multiple times by family members, classmates and even teachers (so you know it isn't biased) that I have a lot of innate intelligence but I just need to apply myself. If I forgot to mention, at this point I really wasn't bothering with high school assignments or even studying, just going with the flow. Ended up finishing high school with average grades, although my SAT score was REALLY good (which reinforces the intelligent but lazy thing). Anyways, did an extra year in a Canadian high school cuz I'm an international student, did pretty well, got into Carleton. 

Now this is where the issue is. University is very different from high school in the sense that you can't just get by. You actually have to put in a lot of effort. But the vicious cycle for me is that I don't see myself as successful so I don't bother putting in work, which makes me fail more, which makes me not see myself as successful. You get the gist.  Now I'm here with a less than desirable GPA, no motivation for a course which at the very least I love, feeling like I've been wasting the really expensive fees my parents have to pay for me to go to school, probably depressed. And I actually want to get myself together but when I think about it I start thinking about how I've already messed up and it's not possible to get my GPA up from such a low starting point in third year. 

I just feel like there's no point. I might as well try just hard enough to graduate instead of wasting more of my parent's money on repeating courses I've failed when I have a younger brother who, in about 3 years, is going to enter university too.

I understand that this topic has been discussed by many people before already, believe me, I've tried my best to read through all of them on both subreddits (Queen's&amp;Western's), and since everybody is in a scenario of their own, I'd just like to get some opinions in regards to my own case. So, fortunately, I received both an offer from Queen's commerce and an Ivey AEO offer from Western. However, as you probably can tell, I'm torn between the two of them. Though I have done my fair share of research for both programs/campuses, I have to admit I am a bit short on Queen's because I received my offer a lot later, so please tell me anything you can or anything you'd like me to know about Queen's!

Some background/preferences of mine:

I am an international student from Taiwan with U.S citizenship, I came to Canada last year (2019) in hopes of completing high school and getting into a Canadian university. Both school's tuition including residence fees is about the same (don't ask me why I didn't just go to the U.S instead, these are confusing times).

I adore the Ivey case-method teaching style. However, I also value the opportunity to go on international exchange A LOT and am glad that Queen's encourages most of its students to go on exchange during their third year. Whereas in Ivey you would essentially shorten your already short 2-years Ivey experience by going on exchange. 

In terms of future prospects, I plan to become a consultant and would most likely work outside of Canada (in the U.S or Taiwan). My short-term goal is to work in a firm that would help me land a top B-School in the U.S when I pursue my MBA. (From what I've researched, Ivey seems to have better placement in the U.S compared to other Canadian business programs, but neither seems to have an advantage outside of North America) 

&amp;#x200B;

My concerns/questions:

Residence - Compared to Western's, I feel like Queen's residence website is a lot harder to access and get information on. Other than the fact that different halls have different room formats are there any specific events that pertain to particular halls and how easy/difficult is it to get involved with people in your hall? How's the study atmosphere in rez? I heard Queen's is also known for being a ""party school"", though I do love to party sometime, I'm afraid it might be too distracting. If anyone can tell me more about the rez life, I would be happy to know! 

Recruiting scene - (First&amp;Second yr) How hard is it to secure business-related summer internships? Are there anything tips on getting an early start career-wise in first&amp;second year? (Later yrs) What is the recruiting scene like in Queen's? When does it usually happen? It'd be great if someone could share some insight with me!

Teaching style/Academics - I heard that Queen's has a more traditional way of teaching with textbooks and theories, and rarely with cases. Personally, I don't think I'm that good of a fit for the traditional teaching style, and I enjoy doing cases more than study from textbooks. Then again, I really have no idea what Queen's has to offer, so to those that have been through the program, please shed some light on what the academic scene would be like, I'd really appreciate it.

Kingston - In comparison to London, Kingston seems to be a smaller town with everything in close proximity, which is something I really like. However, as an Asian that has experienced some difficulty adapting to western cuisine, I'm concerned with the diversity of options that Kingston can provide, culture, and cuisine wise. (In other words, are there accessible/affordable asian restaurants/asian markets near the campus?)

Overall, I believe Queen's would give me a better University experience. It would be less stressful since there is no AEO to maintain, and I would be getting right into business from day 1, the more inclusive community-vibe, and the fact that I could go on exchange. However, Ivey's slight leg up in terms of recruitment and case-method teaching style really puts me on the spot. 

I apologize for asking so many questions and if anything's not stated clearly enough, I tried to be as specific as I could.  I would love to hear your opinions and get into PMs with those that are willing and happy to share your thoughts and experiences with me. Thanks a lot!",0.0

73,"It takes me three years to understand it's okay to give yourself an easier time studying...

As an international student, I initially wanted to make the most out of my tuition by doing a specialist (15FCEs) + a major (8FCEs) and graduating with 24FCEs (so that each credit costs less...). While graduating like this is totally possible, little did I know about how often I need to be stressed about each course. Also, that combination basically leaves me with no room for taking any electives that I really want to take. Specialist programs really leave me with no variety in upper-year courses, all heavily focused on details that I can look up at any time on google. It was really hard to not learn for grades but for the actual content. Finishing both programs in four years+maintain a relatively decent GPA+moving research projects forward+getting my life together is ultra-challenging, especially during the pandemic... 

I'm feeling so good now that I can drop a course or two that I don't really like, have rooms to take courses from other departments, and learn useful skills (always want to learn some basic CS)! Also, finally feel that I have the time to do a deep cleaning of my place : D

It's okay to give yourself extra time to do things. We don't need to be so hard on ourselves: ）

To any first or second-year students: Specialist programs will give you in-depth knowledge on a subject but you might have many courses that you don't really enjoy (it's very hard to like all of your required courses..). A double major or major+double minor will definitely give you more rooms to explore different areas of interest and learn a diverse set of skills. The decision is up to you!",0.0
74,"So I was waitlisted for my First choice program (engineering) and I felt so devastated. Meanwhile, I received an admission offer for my second choice program (Geophysics BSc Honors) and to be honest I was annoyed. Anyways, I started feeling relaxed because I realized I wouldn't have much workload and won't be constantly stressed (notice how I've completely given up on engineering). I know a few things about the Geophysics program but I want to know how it is at U of A. Also, would I have co-op opportunities as an international student?",0.0
75,"I am currently suffering a big issue on one of my mathematical course.

It has a weekly quiz which last 10 minutes. I always got one of the total four questions correct (25%)in the previous quizzes . The quiz part in this course(10 quizzes, multiple choice) will occupy 20% of the total marks. But my other parts seems fair, always above 60%.

It is a relatively difficult course and to be frank, I know our professor has already tried his best to teach us.  I spend a lot of time on it, but it makes little difference.

I just feel too nervous about the timed quiz in a 10 minutes especially when I saw my previous quiz grades on the canvas grade page. I am kind of  perfectionist and could not accept my scores like that, not to mention that I realize the probability of failing the course.

I told my family about the situation and I am quite tired on learning this course, wondering if I can take it in a future term, because I still have some other courses and important exams to prepare currently(it is my first year). My families want me to stick to it because one course takes nearly 3000 dollars for an international students -- if I withdraw it, I definitely need to pay another 3000 dollars in the future term when I take it, otherwise, I may pass it. They care about the money and I couldn't successfully persuade them .

I don't know what should be done next. Any people encountered my situation before?

I am okay when the test has a longer period to complete, but 10 minutes is just too short for me. I know the questions may be easy for some classmates, in fact, in the 1st minutes after submitting the quiz, I already knew why I did wrong on some questions, but when I was taking the quiz, I just felt too stressful and can not even concentrate.

I think this may be a psychological factor, but how to overcome it.

Any suggestion would be appreciated.",0.0
76,"I know there have been a bunch of posts about the fall semester and what people think it will look like, but I'm just curious about what people think regarding international students in the fall. 

There are many countries around the world that will likely keep their borders closed come the fall and I was wondering if people have thought about what this means for international students. I was just thinking that if in person lectures were to half resume in the fall (ie smaller classes proceed in person whereas larger classes are online) what position would international student be in. I imagine that it would be quite stressful for them to leave their country to come back here (if they can?) and not be certain that they would be allowed to return. 

Additionally, if smaller classes were just filmed and posted... is that fair to for international students - like people don't choose where they're born. It seems like a pretty substantial disadvantage as I think it is safe to say online learning wasn't the same (or in some cases like labs, even comparable) as in-person learning.

I personally am Canadian, born and raised in Vancouver, so I know I'm pretty lucky and this entire ordeal has just meant spending more time with my parents, but i really feel bad for international students. 

Curious to here from everyone: Faculty, international students, domestic students, undergrads and grads! I think what this entire ordeal has taught us all is the importance of unity and coming together to face a challenge. :)

81,"With the recent news of a potential suicide at UTSG and the calls for increased mental health, I've realized that I must be missing something about what is going on. 

My U of T experience has been so different from these incidents and I really want to understand what the experience is like for so many of you to better support my fellow students.

I'm an international student at UTM as a Digital Enterprise Management specialist. I feel challenged in my courses and I'm doing pretty well so far, that being said, I know that it's not as hard as other programs like Computer Science. I have a good friend group that supports me emotionally and mentally as well as a strong family base. I've also lived on residence as a student and as a don for my entire stay (before this year) where I've gotten and given a ton of support for mental health, tips to handle school stress, and more. These are things that I am very grateful for and know that I'm lucky to have.

My U of T experience so far has been a fairly steady one. There have definitely been periods of extreme stress with terribly hectic weeks and months, but they have always passed with some combination of support from my loved ones or people on residence. When times were particularly bad and these things couldn't help, I was able to go to the Health and Counselling Center on campus and get mental health care that really pulled me out of that state.

From my perspective, it seems like the University of Toronto (or at least UTM) provides its students with the care that it can, and for me, that care has been really helpful.

But, there is obviously a problem here. One suicide is too much and to have so many occur is more than a serious issue, but is it one that U of T can reasonably be expected to solve? 

I know that if I didn't have the supportive and caring friends and family that I do, that my mental state would definitely fall. If someone doesn't have those (which I'm, assuming is a big component to these mental health issues) what is there that U of T can really do to substitute that? From what I've heard, there is a student culture at UTSG that is all about work and the students don't communicate with or support each other as much as at UTM. Is that true? If so, that seems really damaging to students, but how can U of T really change that?

The way I see it, the university really does seem to be trying to help us. They offer a variety of mental health resources and even if they increased that offering, I'm not sure if it would help as it feels like the problems that are driving people to the edge are more than what a therapist alone fix. People still need the support of friends/family around them. To that end, the uni has even seemed to really be promoting events where students can meet friends, both in past years and in this remote semester. 

This isn't in any way to minimize the feelings and experiences of people going through these things and I completely agree that there are some toxic things that can be changed academically such as the ""only a certain amount of people can get over 70 in this course"" mentality that people have talked about on this sub. But at a certain point, the uni has its hands tied. It can't massively reduce the workload or the difficulty of the work because it needs to uphold a certain level of difficulty to maintain their stellar standing in Canada and the world.

I in no way think that these incidents are the fault of the students who have and are suffering or the student body in general, but I wonder if a lot of blame is being directed towards the school for something they can't reasonably change.

I know that I'm biased because of my own good experiences and because I have no clue how different it is in UTSG or UTSC, but I really do want to understand. Please help me do that.",0.0

I'm a 5th year  Mechanial Engineering student looking to pursue a Masters degree and eventually a PhD in mechatronics, specifically robotics and AI/ML. My GPA is 3.65. During my 3rd year I went to Canada for an exchange semester at Concordia.  I was selected for a stress analysis internship in France but that was cancelled due to COVID so I went back home and did an internship in digital fabrication with an emphasis on 3D printing. During the past year, I've developed an interest in AI. Unfortunately my university doesn't offer any undergrad courses in this topic so I've signed up for some online courses as well as a graduate level AI course in my university, I've also contacted some professors for research work and I should have some research experience by the time the  application deadline for next year's winter  semester comes  by (August/September) . I've been looking for graduate programs in the US and Canada but I'm worried about my lack of experience in this field. I should note that I'm looking for an assistanship as I can't afford international tuition rates. Do you think I should delay my application and pursue work/research experience? Also given my GPA and my status as an international student, are there any schools you suggest I apply to?

84,"Graduated in 2020 April in Ontario. I was expecting to find work with a museum in my related field, but obviously due to COVID that has created a damper on things. Since April my income has been 0, and I can't even find a part time minimum wage job at a fast food/grocery place from looking online. A lot of international students where I live so part time minwage work is extremely competitive. 

I have been living off CERB being extremely frugal (luckily a shared house my rent is only 600$ a month) eating rice and beans and such, but it is going to run out early next year and I'm kind of freaking out about what to do. I talked to my landlord about paying 1/2-3/4 of my rent for a while, but he says the rental agency he works for cant even knock off a dollar (I dont believe him but whatever)

Unemployment Insurance says I had to have been working and lost my job. 

I'm thinking about 'starting my own business' so I can apply for the Canada Recovery Benefit, because that's the only way I can see myself being able to pay my rent.

85,"The 2020 provincial budget just came out. Like every other post-secondary institution in our province, the budget impacts what will happen at our university.  Especially involving things like academic programming, the people that deliver and support that programming, deferred maintenance on our campus, and your tuition and taxes. 

Last fall, the 2019 budget greatly impacted post-secondary students, including making universities (like ours) more reliant on tuition revenues, eliminating beneficial tax credits to students, scrapping the Summer Temporary Employment Program (STEP), reducing student aid funding, raising the interest rate on provincial student loans, and even more. This is what launched the Students Not Silent movement on our campus, which has now spread to campuses across Alberta.

And, now, budget 2020 has doubled down on placing that burden on students. Here’s where things are at now:

Your tuition is still going up.

The provincial government is trying to reduce how much they put into funding post-secondary education, which in turn is forcing institutions to try to find ways to make up those amounts. As per the provincial budget, they expect much of this to be done through increased tuition revenues; tuition is able to increase by an average of 7% each year over the next three years. Some programs will be seeing hikes of up to 10% in 2021 and 2022.

What this means for you: Your education is about to get more expensive. For example, a student taking 10 classes next year could expect to pay at least $370 more in tuition, and $1,200 more by 2022. (Next year, Alberta tuition will be 375% higher than it was in 1990-91; that's five times the rate of inflation!)


On top of that, there is a lot of pressure on the university to fill seats, by whatever means.

Even though we’re already at record enrolment levels, the provincial budget is projecting tuition revenues to increase 6.9% in each of the next three years. That puts major stress on the university to fill seats, despite cuts to programs, more expensive tuition, job loss, and a low priority on addressing maintenance issues in student spaces. 

What this means for you: Your class sizes will probably be larger. And, considering the university is likely to reduce courses being offered, it will probably be harder for you to get into classes or have options to fit into your schedule. 


Even if the U of A performs well, there won’t be any funding increases. 

The new performance-based funding model’s ""all stick, no carrot"" approachmeans there’s nowhere to go but down: hidden cuts will drain university funding even beyond the new 11% cut to operating funding.

What this means for you: There’s a really, really good chance that programs and courses are going to be facing further, deeper cuts.


And, still:

Your tuition and education tax credits aren’t coming back, and can no longer be accrued. (Note: you can still use ‘em if you got ‘em.) You and your family used to be eligible for tax credits of around $1000 per year of university. Those tax credits were eliminated on January 1st.

Your Alberta student loans are going to be more expensive to pay back.Many of us probably got the email that interest on student rates are now higher. At this new rate, an average total loan amount of $30,000, over 10 years, will cost you about $1,800 extra over the course of your repayment. 

Student mental health funding is uncertain, at best. The one-year renewal on mental health funding (shared with other institutions) is set to expire March 31, 2021, and we don’t know if the U of A’s chunk of that will be less than it has been before. 

No sustainable solution to address deferred maintenance. The U of A needs around $150 million a year for building maintenance and repairs, yet only $35 million has been allocated. It would take much more than that to fix what needs to be fixed: in five years, the U of A’s deferred maintenance liability will be almost $900 million.


What happens now?

The U of A has difficult decisions to make. We already have an idea of what those difficult decisions mean for students, but with the new performance-metric model to be implemented in less than a month, and the shocking 11% cut to the U of A’s operating grant, you should be anticipating big changes.  

Seriously, the 11% cut to the U of A’s operating grant is devastating. And disproportionately higher than the 6.3% cut at the University of Calgary. Coupled with last fall’s 6.9% cut, that means UAlberta is losing roughly $110 million within a few months. Hundreds of jobs are going to be lost. The Board of Governors thought they were being safe by planning for a 5% cut this year. They were wrong.

There are big increases coming to student tuition, fees, parking rates, residence rates, and meals plans. The hikes to parking rates, meal plans, and residence rents (at or below 5%) have already been decided. The Board of Governors will make decisions on tuition, fees, and residence rents (above 5%) on March 13:

Tuition: Increasing by 7% for domestic students and 4% for continuing (non-cohorted) international students. Our advocacy efforts succeeded in directing 15% of that new tuition revenue for domestic students to needs-based student financial aid (about $1.83M), and limiting international tuition increases to 4%; they could have been much higher.

Parking rates: Increasing 2% across the board, or between $1.79-$4.25 more per month, depending on location.

Mandatory Non-Instructional Fees: Increasing by 2.67% overall (an extra $21.12/year for a full-time student). This breaks down into a 10% increase for the Athletics and Recreation fee, a 0.94% increase for the Academic Support fee, and a 0% increase for the Health and Wellness fee.

Residence rates: Most residences are to increase their rates by 5% (an extra $37-$80 per month), while East Campus Village’s transition from 11 to 8 month leases would increase rates by 10%, and, concluding renovations, Lister-Mackenzie residence would increase by 72% for single rooms and 116% for doubles ($493 more/month for a 1-bedroom, and $524 more/month for a 2-bedroom).

Meal plans: 2.9% increases across the board for Lister, Peter Lougheed, and Augustana (costing $130-$148 more per year).",0.0

89,"University campus life is an overarching experience at most public research universities across the country, and there is no doubting that U of C shares in this sentiment. Between the ever charming Fiji Frat boys in their Patagonia  vests to the cult like chanting of GNCTR on their way to a pub crawl dressed inappropriately for the weather, and everyone in between on BSD (remember that?) U of C students sometimes know how to have fun. 

That is sometimes. 

It is not a secret that a lot of Cal and Garys complain about going to a post secondary education institution in their hometown. Cries of “I hate my commute from Okotoks” or “I can’t work on the group project, I need to get home to Airdrie to pick up my sister from high school” or “Calgary is so lame, there is nothing to do here” are not infrequent, often falling on deaf ears of international students and people from towns where the best form of entertainment you have is walking around inside a Walmart and then also loitering in your car outside said Walmart after harassing your one friend that works there. 

The bottom line is that a large selection of U of Sea students like to keep to themselves in class, then drive home to their parents house that they have lived in since pre K while lamenting about how no one at U of C is cool or fun or nice or interesting or not boring or insert negative adjective here. THERE’S NO SENSE OF COMMUNITY HERE people say, as they literally sprint out of science theatres after interacting with no one except that one person from high school I didn’t really know but they’re chill I guess and it’s someone to sit with in class so we aren’t friends but like I know them.

That is not to say there aren’t some juicy little tidbits here and there where students actually interact with others in a natural attempt to ascertain romantic interest. Anonymous confession pages on facebook, instagram, and what basically just used to be Yik Yak are not new. In fact, if you look up certain strings of keywords you can find ancient UGary Forums full of gossip on professors, TAs, and other interdepartmental drama that predate the current KarJenner-James Charles influencer era we have somehow extracted out of the timeline. 

The common theme in a lot of these archival works is a need for escapism, in particular the undergrad academic sphere. How else am I supposed to get through Math 265? 

To the blonde girl in Math 265 that was sitting in the front row of ST 140 wearing grey leggings, a blue sweater and air force ones and had a pink cover on her apple pencil please have my children.

Harmless. Funny. It’s a spectacle. “What if she actually hits this guy up? Imagine that!” The checklist works. Adrenaline to the confession sender, serotonin to every blonde girl in the class as she tries to remember every outfit she’s ever worn MWF 11-11:50 for the last month, and a great time to everyone else spectating wondering if anonymous sender would actually follow through on their promise, whether blonde girl is already cuffed to someone else, and general giddiness about something new, something unfamiliar... IT WAS THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY WE WERE LOOKING FOR!!!!

U of C Confessions, formally known as @uofconfessions, on instagram was created in 2018, coincidentally my first year at U Carrie. Off the bat, it was a massive success. Confessions such as “Farrah A in Engg 201 can i eat your ass” to “I slept with my ex best friends dad” garnered likes, comments, and were furiously sent between group chats. Some confessions would cement themselves with godlike status among friend groups who would eagerly share these posts back and forth and await the next spicy little blurb that some horny mf wanted the world to know. 

Due to its immense popularity, (U of C) Confessions took on new admins as it grew and began to promote Friday Feelsday, a segment where every Friday a huge dump of romantic, horny, or nice comments (weird combo i know) would be posted to the page. These posts are distinct - instead of white text they use pink for love. (Pink... for love? Groundbreaking.) The Friday Feelsday segments became a staple and people would genuinely be excited to see what was happening and who wanted to bonk who that coming weekend. It was great! The admins were awesome and funny, they put so much effort into making fun content for everyone - they were handling confessions with grace and good moral character. They provided resources during dark times on campus and were really stepping up to create, again, a sense of community. 

Here and there they had their problematic stints - an admin was fired due to something I can’t remember, they occasionally get hate for a confession that someone else posted and then it’s taken down and the subsequent notes apology appears on their story explaining their reasoning on the guise of being transparent. 

As Uncle Ben said (not the Racist Rice Caricature I mean spider-man): 

“With great power comes great responsibility. “

And thus U of Confessions began to get drunk on their influence like a 15 year old TikTok Star. 

It’s not all bad though. Recently what you can find on the page is a mixture of:

I love XYZ prof they are so nice 

*insert the exact copy of a twitter meme or tik tok joke that someone really sat there, typed out, and submitted like it was their own original thought* (academic misconduct anyone)

“shout out to this very specific group of 5+ people i will now fully name, we are such good friends but i will tell u on this anonymous confessions site rather than in our super rad groupchat “

“I bet the admins are hot”

“my professor *insert ethical violation here* and Papa Frank in the comments like: Hi! This isn’t okay. please forward this informa 

and lastly,

SU election candidates and their platforms for some reason??

Very politely warning you this next section has mentions of suicidal ideation and depression so please click off if these are a trigger for you.

As U of C Confessions Renegaded their way to the top, they dealt with more and more confessions from people just like you:

“I’m depressed, I don’t see a point in life anymore”

“I’m so depressed and the wellness centre isn’t doing anything for me”

“I’ve dishonoured my parents. I can’t keep pretending anymore”

And since U of Confessions wanted to be a safe space, a community space, and a space where everyone had a voice...

They posted confessions like these. They posted them to a public instagram page, which as of today has 11K followers. And this is why I am writing this essay. Because I woke up this morning to those story posts. The story posts of U of C Confessions admins platforming someone who was having suicidal thoughts, who was telling the admins that they were being ignored for not posting their confessions. And so the admins put up stories attempting to talk this person down, get them help, trying in earnest to make this messy situation better. 

Then they got criticism. Someone told them they should “stop playing therapist, stop acting like a professional, and so they agreed. But they agreed by saying 

“barring the unnecessarily aggressive nature of this [confession], I completely agree” 

then, deflect, deflect deflect with more of the same old - “if any of you dinos need help,” please look at this link uwu 💖 don’t kill yourself pwease there are dinos out here to help you we love you! uwu!

According to wikipedia (don’t @ me)

Parasocial interaction refers to a kind of psychological relationship experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters with performers in the mass media, particularly on television. Viewers or listeners come to consider media personalities as friends, despite having limited interactions with them.

In caveman: Someone famous. Someone not famous. Not famous likes famous so pretend famous is friend.

 It’s the reason that we have all that self insert Dream Minecraft fan fiction where people are very obviously thirsting for these streamers and infaltilozing these grown men and it’s kinda weird because they’re making POVs of them having sex with these people and they’re like real people and it’s weird and

I think you get what I mean. These parasocial relationships that people have with youtubers or celebrities or  who the fuck ever walk a thin line between innocent and dangerous. I believe that U of C Confessions has created this parasocial, ✨we are all friends Dinos! 💖 attitude on their page and it has resulted in absolutely banal mediocre content, a huge community of people that don’t know eachother but pretend they are best friends, immense virtue signalling, and an attitude of sickly sweet positivity which borders on near censorship (I wish I had a less Fox News word for this but I don’t okay I said BORDERING on censorship don’t crucify me i’m not one of those people who think the government is hiding LSD from us so we don’t become woke or something please hear me out). 

We have reached a point in time where U of C Confessions has fallen from its former grace such a long way that it’s community was we knew it in the rose-tinted Feelsdays is over, and people are catching on. Arguing in the comments with your followers when you disagree with them when you’re basically a glorified meme page that wants to put a band aid on every owie a Dino has is weird. And this brings me to my final point:

U of C Confessions operates like a club. they recruit executives like an SU club and have these people create content for them. They’re “hiring” right now. The only reason why they couldn’t be a club is that they value their anonymity. If they were registered with the SU their identities would become public knowledge and the parasocial friendship everyone has with these mysterious admins would dissipate and the magic would be gone. 

Because U of C Confessions will never operate as a club, they will never need to abide my club rules. SU club spaces on campus are no-campaign zones. You wouldn’t see a club on campus attempting to publicly talk someone away from the edge of their darkest thoughts on a fucking instagram story because it’s weird. It’s unethical. It’s ... problematic. 

For this reason, I will finally stop bitching and unfollow the page like the good little snowflake I am. I’ll be offended by the lack of once semi offensive content this page given us so much of. It’s a watered down cesspool of toxic positivity where every person is heard and loved and a part of the community that they have created where everyone knows no one else.  

And with that, I will go click that unfollow button on this godforsaken page that has expired like that one yogurt your roommate left in your shared mini fridge in Rundle.

I've been studying in BC as an international student for 2 years. I have gotten accepted into my alternate program in sfu which is molecular biology &amp; biochemistry. It is a very hard program as I have seen and heard from people but mostly their goals are going into med school whereas my goal is to work in a pharmaceutical field. I am interested in this program but worrying is this degree really worth it or useful after undergrad since I want to get a job after undergrad because I want to reduce the stress of my parents paying for the tuition fee and apply for PR. On the other hand, I have just got rejected from UBC science today which is the school I prefer going than sfu. However, I have also been accepted into associate degrees of CS and chemistry in langara college respectively. I am wondering how is the MBB program is like and which choice would be better for future careers at this moment in Canada/Vancouver as the deadline to accept the program is on the 1st of June.

Thank you!",0.0
91,"No one asked to be in middle of a pandemic. No one wanted to be stranded thousands of miles away from their homes. No one asked to be left alone with not many social interactions. But we are in those situations. And our university is making it worse.

Taking a full course load, especially engineering students, in middle of a pandemic with lockdown, little to no social interactions and a general sense of insecurity is already very stressful. But the university is making it worse. They are now saying professor need not record for privacy purposes. They are not speaking against SEM. International students across the globe are facing difficulties. Some professors are adding more course load than they would otherwise do. A few weeks ago I saw a post where they said class average was extremely low around 30(?) for an engineering course. Who is holding them accountable? Is our SU responsible for this? 

I really don't know how things will go. I am in the second year of Fresh Start because and taking a fairly light course load with courses I like and from accommodating professors. I have the stress of whether I will get back into university at least this Fall 2021. But I have to accept that I am at a certain privilege due to reduced course load (*12 per semester). Also I am an international student in Edmonton, away from my family.

I cannot sleep peacefully knowing that my fellow students, my community members are suffering. And I don't know what to do or whom to talk to. I may not know majority of our students, but we are all in the same community. It might sound like a virtue signal, but I will stand up for my community especially the ones suffering. In my home country, I know the ways to express demands. But what can I do here? All I am doing right now, is listening to my friends and being there for them. What else can I do? I am not all powerful who can change things in a snap, but I want to do what I can for my peers. Please give me suggestions.",0.0
92,"Interact with your STUDENTS AND STAFF. Set up an inbox for suggestion about how to move forward. For example, ask us if we would be interested in online therapy sessions set by the university. We are the ones affected primarily by grades and these changes. Not the administration nor the university, US. Ask us what would be beneficial for us going forward. Form a poll with a variety of options. Have us vote. Send one final email about the results. Obviously, there will be discontent from people who didn’t have their option chosen. It’ll be what the majority of students wanted which is in no way fair to the minority but these decisions will never be fair. Yet, they have two valuable points. Discussion and Transparency. We get what the fuck is going on. 

For example, if we’d been in the loop about the transition to remote instruction, we could’ve asked what would happen to labs and exams before a final decision was made.

I’m just tired of the wishy washy decisions. If the majority feel mandatory CR/NCR is appropriate, the discussion can be over because the majority of students wanted it and we all were in the loop. 

But when we’re forced to accept things without any consideration for alternative options, that’s when students feel angry. 

Don’t send a million emails. Don’t make us wait for them all night. Don’t make us stressed out. Don’t tell us you care about our mental health and your staff when you throw things at us and force us to accommodate. Don’t change your policies the next day. Don’t tell your instructors to change their entire teaching style and assessments again and again. Don’t tell people in residence to move out four days before and stress out our international students. I can’t even begin to imagine their pain. 

I get that the administration is doing the best they can in a rough time but we’re human too and we are the ones affected the most by everything. You’re making an already difficult situation worse.",0.0
93,"I’m currently staying abroad and I have been deciding whether to take summer courses or not for last few weeks. 

I was not sure about taking the courses I registered and I decided to drop it at night on May 14th which was the last day for dropping the course without standing withdrawal. However, because my internet connection was bad occasionally, I couldn’t access the internet at night time on that day properly and I was keep failing to access the SSC at the time. Since I can access the page just now, I could just drop the courses, but I have W standing for those courses and the SSC says I found out I have to pay tuition for those courses.

I am so stressed about this situation. I don’t know what to do as paying $3936.50 for the two courses because of my bad internet connection on the last day of withdrawal is stressing me out. As a international student, the amount of tuition for the two courses is tremendous and the thing that I might have to pay it because I missed the last day to drop without withdrawal due to the technical problem makes me feel so anxious and confused. I seriously don’t know what to do now. I know I should have not missed the last day to drop without withdrawal but I changed my mind on the last day and I figured out I cannot access the SSC at that moment because of my internet which was night time. Should I talk to the tuition department in the school? Has anyone experienced this kind of situation? I’m in panic and so stressed.",0.0

I'm an international student from the US and I'm looking to take Math 203 and Math 204 in the fall. I was initially going to take Math 201 in the fall but thankfully I've been granted an exemption for the class having taken pre-calculus in high school. It's been a couple years since then and I'm wondering if I should take a pre-calculus course this summer at my local college for confidence since it'd cost me a little extra and make the period where I'd be solely focusing on moving and perpetration a little more stressful. But, if it should be done, then I won't hesitate.

95,"I received an acceptance from the UofA for the Fall 2021 intake. 
I decided to do a quick search on the job prospects after a Crim major (also looking forward to co-op and AWE).
The results have me stressed. 
Some posts and reviews say that getting a well paying job (&gt;30K) as a correctional officer, etc etc is easy, but the others have nothing but negative comments like (crim is a useless degree, you'll be better off selling pizzas). 
I was disheartened, to say the least. I'm an international student, who'll have a student debt of about a 100K (which I'm not stressing over if i make a little shy of 40K p/a). 
I'm passionate about the subject, but also know that getting a good job is equally important. My question:  

A. Crim grads from the UofA, what profession did you take up after graduating, and what was your pay?

B. Did the Campus Career Fair help you in securing a job? 

C. How do you think the job market will be after 4 - 5 years for a crim degree? 

D. How helpful were the Mohawk Certificates and the co-op program in your career-making? 


I'm really, really stressed at this point thinking about the stagnation of the job market,and lack of resources available for potential crim grads (specially at the uofa)

If I end up not securing a good job, then I don't see the point of racking up student debt and studying in Canada.

98,"&gt;Student leaders play a critical role on campus, including articulating student concerns and advocating for positive change. This week, student representatives on General Faculties Council spoke passionately and thoughtfully on behalf of their fellow students, raising our awareness of the significant barriers some students are experiencing in today’s remote learning environment.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;COVID-19 has fundamentally changed the university experience this year, not only at the U of A but across Canada and around the world. Adapting to remote learning has required a tremendous amount of creativity, training and hard work from students and instructors alike. University is never easy--at its best it challenges all involved to push beyond expectations. But add in the complications and demands of new technology, odd learning schedules, new forms of assessment, and online classroom dynamics and the pressures can be overwhelming and detrimental to mental and physical health.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Our student leaders raised a number of important issues at GFC. We heard that some international students face major time zone barriers which hamper their ability to participate in synchronous formats. Regularly attending class in the middle of the night is unsustainable and can result in highly adverse impacts on the personal health and wellness of our students. We heard that in some courses assessment methods, particularly participation grades that may in effect require students to attend class in the middle of the night, need to adapt to better reflect the realities of online learning. Online proctoring tools can increase student anxiety during an assessment by requiring students to show where they live, be in an interruption-free space with bright lighting, maintain a stable internet connection, maintain consistent eye contact with a webcam, all while undergoing the stress of writing an exam. Rural students may face difficulties because their access to the required technology cannot be achieved or guaranteed. Students who parent may face conflicting time commitments just when they need to be in class themselves.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Many of these issues are shared issues. Instructors also face time constraints and conflicts with familial demands. Overcoming the challenges of delivering course material remotely takes hours of extra preparation. Alternative and non-traditional forms of assessment add time and effort to an already overloaded schedule. An enormous amount of work has been done by highly dedicated U of A instructors to provide the best possible learning experiences for their students in a very difficult time.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I want to acknowledge and thank both students and instructors for all of the work that has been done to adapt. While there is hope on the horizon, we will continue to rely on remote learning environments through Spring and Summer terms and so we must continue to work together to improve things, address issues as they arise, and put in place solutions.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no one easy solution and the critical starting point is always a conversation between students and instructors to first identify any barriers and then to develop alternatives. We know that conversations like these are happening everyday and alternatives are actively being put in place. We are committed to ensuring that no one is left with an unresolved situation. Provost Steven Dew and I want to assure students of the following:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Where students have medical, technological, accessibility, or other barriers, the university is fully committed to providing reasonable solutions.   
&gt;  
&gt;Students, especially those in other time zones and rural locations, with legitimate limitations in their ability to participate in synchronous learning and assessment will be offered reasonable course adaptations.   
&gt;  
&gt;Students who experience barriers due to medical, disability, or other protected grounds must be reasonably accommodated.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are also committed to ensuring that students and instructors have tools and resources to help break down the barriers, clarify expectations, and resolve individual issues. The Dean of Students is available to support all these conversations as needed.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, Provost Steven Dew is immediately striking a Task Force on Remote Teaching and Learning. This group will include students and instructors and will facilitate participation from across the university. As a priority, the Task Force will move quickly on the issue of online proctoring, with the immediate goal of reducing as much as possible the use of any online proctoring in the upcoming spring/summer term. The Task Force will also develop a fast and effective process for identifying and addressing other issues as they arise.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I want to end with a note of gratitude. COVID-19 has for the moment changed university life deeply; we must work together as best we can to maintain the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff during this global pandemic. Until we can return to normal, extra efforts will continue to be needed and I am deeply thankful for all that has and will continue to be done. Above all, I want to express my sincere thanks to our student leaders for bringing some critical issues to the fore and all our dedicated instructors and administrators who are doing all they can to support our students during this challenging time. I ask that all of us continue to keep the lines of communication open, so that we can work together to handle the many challenges we face together.

100,"Im an international student here and my parents made a transfer to my chequing account from my home country via  Western Union and it has been well over two weeks (&gt; 10 business days) since the transfer was made. I am trying to access those essential funds (living expenses, rent, transport, etc.) but everytime I get on the phone with TD's customer support and wiggle my way through their automated system, I am told they have limited staff and it automatically hangs up the phone.

You mean to tell me that the $ which was supposed to be in my account two weeks ago isn't there and I can't even get on the phone with a representative. That amount is as essential as it gets for me for all the expenses I have and I will be requesting bigger transfers from back home to pay my tuition fees for the Summer semester and I don't know what to expect in that case either. 

I understand that a lot of the staff is overworked and under stress but this is a complaint towards the bank as a whole. Iirc there was a post on here a week back talking about TD customer support staff being forced to work in close proximity to each other eventhough large chunks of their work could be done from home and over the phone.

102,"I am making this post because I don't know where else to turn to and I don't know If I can continue on with living. No, I am not actively trying to end my life but I have been thinking about it a lot.

I am 23. I grew up in the middle east and come from a religious family. Growing up I was indoctrinated to not just believe the super conservative islamic values but also that if your parents aren't happy with the decisions you make, you will go straight to hell. We used to have discussions about how teens in american tv shows or movies would argue with their parents and how that was such a horrible thing to do. 

I found out I was gay when I was 9. I didn't come out to anyone until I was at least 16 to one of my close friends who was pretty supportive. I have had mixed reactions from people when I came out to them but nothing was worst than coming out to my siblings. They laughed and told me how horrible it was and that I should be ashamed of ever thinking about men in that way. I would also like to point out that my older brother came out as a transgender when I was 15 and for years I saw my family make his life a living hell and treat him like shit. When you, as a gay person, see the way your family, who you had been conditioned to love no matter what since you were born, see treat an LGBT family member that way, it frightens you. Especially when you are that young. My sister ratted me out to my mother when I was 18 and got mad at me for not speaking to her (she claimed she never told mom but mom isn't good at keeping secrets I found out she actually did.) I even heard mom talk to my sisters about how unlucky she was to have kids like me and my brother and constantly compare us to my elder sisters who followed the path my parents set for them. Over the years I have heard my family say so many horrible stuff about LGBT people around me. Life became unbearable and I knew I had to leave for my own mental health. My family agreed to let me do my undergrad in another middle eastern country (I convinced them that I would be straight. Didn't ever tell dad otherwise I doubt he would let me go) I got into some good universities in canada and the Uk but family wouldnt let me go there. Mostly because this was the first time I was travelling abroad on my own.

Yes, I had to rely on my dad financially because in the middle east, especially if you are an expat or in a student visa, you arent allowed to work (my parents are not originally from middle east they moved there back in 70s. and no, middle east doesnt grant PR no matter how long you lived there)  while I was doing my undergrad, I was miserable. I was surrounded by closed-minded people. I decided to use grindr out of loneliness and met a guy (33M) who I stayed in a relationship with for 3 years.

The relationship was absolutely toxic. He was emotionally, physically and sexually abusive towards me.  He would often hit me or tell me what I could or couldn't wear. I fell deep into depression and I was scared to let him go because I had no one else. My relationship with my family was just getting worse, I couldn't make any good friends at uni. He was all I had. He was also a little racist and always talked about how lazy and dumb brown people were. I started feeling terrible about myself. I hated my personality. I looked at non-brown people and saw myself as an inferior. My grades in university started slipping in the 2nd year however I was able to work harder in 3rd year and graduated with 4.0 GPA. 

2018 was a total hell. My dad  had a heart attack and had to be hospitalized, I had to move back with my family since I was done with uni and the student visa was expiring, my family cut my brother off, my brother got into some legal issues because of being trans and had no support, my ex who I really wanted to be there for me was cheating on me, I was struggling to find work. I sunk extremely deep into depression and lost complete motivation to do anything. All i wanted to do was get drunk, high, fuck and party. I got some job but at this point my mental health was so bad that I couldn't focus at all. Being around my family was also a torture. My dad told me I should allow for masters in the west if I wanted. I was happy about that. I got into a great college in canada but my family didn't let me go to canada. They told me I had to look for a uni in the UK. Problem with the UK is that it is extremely hard for international students to get a job after education. I tried to argue so much but they didn't listen to me. They consider my eldest sisters smarter than me. I told them I wanted to continue working and then pay for my masters myself. They didn't listen. I was so desperate to get out of that environment that I agreed to move to the UK.

in the UK, I completely lost it in the beginning. I was just getting drunk and having sex  with guys all the time. I did also experience some sexual assaults. My mental health is extremely bad. I am not able to focus on anything anymore. I could at least remain focused on my education but even that has been effected. From the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. I feel nothing but anxiety and depression. Also because of the COVID situation lots of companies are not providing visa sponsorships. I applied to so many places and almost all of them turned me down because they couldn't deal with the visa sponsorship. I have got 4 months to find something. If I don't, I will have to return back home and live in the closet again scared of getting caught by the law for being gay and dealing with my family's mental torture. If I had moved to canada, it would have been so much easier.

I am so done with life. I hate living and I feel like things will just never get better. I have no one I can consider close to me because I have been hurt so many times I keep people at a distance. On top of that my mental health fucks things up too. There is so much more that has happened over the years that I cant explain here. I am sorry for boring you guys with this.

104,"Hi all, just have a quick question regarding the academic integrity policy of U of T.

I took IB before joining uni and as some of you may know that the 2020 IB may/June exam was cancelled due to COVID. Due to the financial difficulties of my family, I decided to work a bit to relieve the stress for my parents during the period that was supposed to be my finals. However, I was just 18 y/o as an international student in Malaysia, and it’s not possible for me to work without a working permit. So I decided to be a ghostwriter and at that time, I didn’t know anything about the severity of academic offense. But I have realized it before I was enrolled in the first year when I was doing some preparations about the policies of u of t. Therefore, I stopped what I was doing immediately and not anymore when the uni started.

I’m quite worried right now if the uni finds out my behavior before I was enrolled, is it going to have an impact on my academic integrity?",0.0
105,"As you may know, Trudeau has just announced the Canada Emergency Student Benefit that will give students $1250 a month from May to August. One eligibility requirement is that you must make under $1000 if you’re working and so I have to ask, why?

If a student was making X amount a month and has their wage decreased by Y percent, it’s affecting them no matter what. Their cost of living is tied to how much they were making, there’s no way they could’ve accounted for a pandemic. So the idea that students aren’t affected by decreased wages if they’re making under $1000 is ludicrous. 

$1000 is a very restrictive amount too. In Alberta, not accounting for taxes, thats 67 hours of work a month or ~17 hours a week. What about essential workers who work more than 17 hours a week but not full time. They’re working harder than before because of panic buying, sanitizing things etc. They’re at a huge risk to get it and they KNOW that. The mental stress of working in something like retail right now is really high but if you work 17 hours a week you get nothing. It incentivises going to your ESSENTIAL service job less so that you have enough to live on. 

Think about it, you make $900 a month and get the benefit getting you to $2150 but if you make $1100 you get no benefit and get $1100. making $200 should not make the difference of meeting requirements and getting help. Id say both the person making $1100 and the person making $900 are both in need of help but only one will get it and that isnt right.

Now what about me? I used to work 100 hours a week at minimum wage at a gas station but hours were cut and now i work 74 hours. Ive lost a huge amount of my wage i needed to live on but i still make too much to get help but i still really need the benefit. I could ask to work less but I dont want to inconvenience my boss  and make him go in because he has a newborn and his father living with him and hes a really good guy. I talked to him about it and he says he more than understands my predicament and can cut a shift a week to get me below the $1000 threshold if I need him to. However, a coworker is leaving in may and he has to hire someone so he warned me “im more than happy to help you but remember that when i hire someone i cant hire them under the pretense of getting 3 shifts a week and then just take one away and give it back to you when this is all over” and i can understand that to be honest. So basically, i take the financial security right now and risk it in the future or fuck myself over right now. That is a failing of the CESB in my opinion.

So what do I think should be done? Im the one complaining so I should have a solution. 
Make it universal to students.

Its already less than the CERB.
The government profits off of us as it is through interest on student loans.
EVERYONE is struggling right now.
A wage reduction is a wage reduction no matter the beginning amount.

Will some students possibly make like $3000 a month with no income cap? Probably. But its a price im willing to pay to make sure people (including myself) dont fall through the cracks.

The CESB should’ve been universal from its inception and included international students.

106,"Hi everyone. I'm a 12th grade international student who is interested in applying.I just want to know about your learning experience during the pandemic. How is it so far ? Are your prof helpful ? What is it like ? ( zoom class,power points etc, ) Do you think it is worth it paying for the college tuition during the pandemic? I'm just worried that I will have to pay money for watching videos without actually learning anything.( I will  apply for Compsci Data Analytics or mobile computing).

I have so many pros and cons about each university making me confused. For Uvic, they say it is a really balanced school but its computer science program is not as good as SFU and Alberta but its social life is good. the only problem is comparing to SFU it had a lower rank and fewer opportunities maybe? In the end, does Rank even matter?

For SFU, the only problem is social life because it is a commuting school and they say it is really hard to make new networks for international students. Is Social life really that bad? Should I value my social life over my opportunity? Will living on campus change anything? Is it a struggle to get a coop? I have a background of getting really bad depression that's why I am asking for help.

For UAlberta, everything is good but they don't provide coop they only give internships which is one of the main factors I am looking at. So I don't think I will be going there.  

No school is perfect, but I'm just trying to select the balanced school out of them all which has a good coop, social life, and course. So what is your opinion on this situation? I'm so confused.",0.0
116,"Disturbed and distressed with Laurier’s mandatory STAQ program. I am an international student returning to Canada to resume my semester. I will be travelling with the required COVID negative certificate. I also have a leased apartment in Waterloo to quarantine for 14 days with no roommate during that period. 

Yet, under Laurier’s STAQ program I am forced to pay CAD 1000 for a compulsory quarantine in an on-campus residence. This payment will be in addition to my housing rental of CAD 700 which I’m already paying. During these challenging financial times, I can ill afford this additional financial burden. How can I be forced to quarantine at the uni when I cannot afford it. 

I’m also worried that my specific diet requirements might be grossly compromised in such a setting. While the world adopts austerity measures &amp; the Govt of Canada too is empathetically in stating “all travellers must arrange for a suitable place to quarantine within one’s financial means,” it’s highly disappointing that Laurier’s STAQ program seems to be insensitive to its international student community who feel grossly discriminated by this rule. 

I would appreciate all fellow hawks to tweet the Students Union twitter and the Wilfrid Laurier University twitter to help me out :(

If an international student from the US was hired as a part time independent contractor for software development, how do you pay Canadian taxes (BC )?

The company paying is very, very small and is unclear on the tax situation for independent contractors so not really helpful (but definitely not an employee situation for a T4). The guardian who was hired is also not able to answer the questions. We've read through the tax q&amp;a on the government website but can't find anything specific to this situation.

So, with those avenues closed off, we are hoping to figure out who can help. Income for all of the tax year was less than $3000.

122,"It just has been so ridiculous how impossible it is to get a psychiatrist in Student Wellness Centre, especially during such a stressful period.

Not only this university milks international students all around, but we didn't even get a cut in prices after things went online. I don't think I'm crazy for thinking that after all that money people shouldn't be spit in the face like this.

Most of the psychiatrists in my home country are terrible and part of the reason I came here a while ago was to get help from student wellness center, since they can't offer services to students outside Canada for some reason. I was assigned a CBT doctor a month ago, and I will still be waiting for weeks to talk to one, and I don't even want to think about when I will actually be seeing a psychiatrist.

I'm an international student and is living in Canada alone.

124,"Hi y'all, I am an incoming fall international student (Hong kong) for molecular biology &amp; biochemistry. As all the classes are going to be online (hopefully won't), I am thinking to just stick with the online classes for the coming semester because I do not think I should waste any time on my road to get a PR in Canada (main goal). 

Here are my three plans:

1. Hopefully, I can get PGWP (an open work permit) after graduation and find a full-time job in Canada that relates to my major, whether it is a lab job or not.

2. I will have to grind through my study at SFU and apply for grad school! This is also a way to get a PR but will take more time and money, plus it is not an easy route.

125,"Hi all!

I'm a library assistant (acquisitions) at a large academic library in Southern California; I've been in this position for 2 1/2 years and before that worked as a student assistant in the metadata department for 2 1/2 years. I've decided I want to get my library degree (I know, in the middle of a pandemic and possible recession, great timing!) If anything, the pandemic's actually strengthened my conviction, as the surge in acquisitions' workload (lots of electronic things suddenly needed, as we all know!) at the beginning of COVID-19 made me really appreciate the direct correlation of my ordering work to providing the access our faculty, students, and staff really need. 

Recently (read: since I can't do any of the physicaly receiving I'd normally do this point in the year), I've had the opportunity to do a few ""extracurriculars""- working on an anti-racism libguide with some of the librarians at my academic library, putting together a short program and discussion on African-American illustrators for coworkers, and now have the opportunity to participate in writing an ALA proposal on diversity and inclusion- that have made me realize that I love the profession, principles of intellectual freedom and freedom of access, and want to move up to doing actual librarian work. 

I want to become an academic librarian- perhaps an instruction and outreach librarian, as I really love teaching and leading conversations, or a subject librarian specializing in history or literature, though I do not have a second masters and accept this may be tough without that to serve as proof of one's expertise in the subject. 

I've looked into several programs- all in-person, since I really do not learn well when not immersed in an environment, and I intend to get the most I can out of this degree.  UBC's really stands out to me for the following reasons:

1. Ability to shift between concentrations. I have two BAs, one in literature and one in cognitive science, so I'm a big fan of working in interdisciplinarily. I particularly like the possibilities of their Communities and Culture concentration mixed with Information Interaction and Design, and of course would be taking the academic librarianship courses.
2. First Nations Concentration Curriculum. While I probably wouldn't apply for this concentration, I'd like to take some of the courses, like their ""Information Practice and Protocol in Support of Indigenous Initiatives"" so that I could potentially apply that to Native American communities in the US if I came back to the States.
3. Ability to take up to 12 credits outside School of Information. I'd take history courses, definitely. 
4. Co-Op program for work experience- very important to me to gain experience outside of acquisitions and cataloging and add more library work to my resume. 
5. Option to write a thesis. What can I say, I'm a glutton for punishment. 
6. Cost. Even for an international student it's less than half as much as some US in-person MLIS programs, and with an International Student Award (though I won't bank on it) I could easily see myself paying for the tuition and fees out-of-pocket, which just leaves living expenses to take care of. I intend to have a part-time job, and the exchange rate is currently in my favor.
7. I'd be lying if I said I weren't thinking about trying to gain PR and staying in Canada permanently. I know it's tough for an American to get a job and will become even more so in the coming years, but it's an attractive option, and I can always go back to the US since UBC is ALA-accredited. 
8. Vancouver is a gorgeous, fun city that seems to have a strong writing community. I write on the side (even though I'd go for an MFA before this), so this is really exciting to me.

At this point, I've gone over all the individual courses, costs, application components with a fine-tooth comb, and started casually looking into the process of getting a student visa- but I can't find much information on what it's actually like to attend or what jobs people who've graduated from there have gotten. (I also can't tell how hard it is to get in, much to my dismay- I'm building up anxiety around writing the statement of purpose, thinking it'll never be good enough). Does anyone have any first-hand experience or second-hand info on UBC they could share? Thanks in advance!",0.0
126," 

It all started with a call last week from my sister. She sprained her ankle and had her job the next day. She was crying in pain but couldn’t afford to not go to work as it was her first day and can't afford to lose her summer job. She got hired in her new job in late March but had exams and other part-time jobs ( international students have a 20 hour per week limit during studies and can work full time during scheduled break). But her new employer was so helpful that he allowed her to start in may so she couldn't say no this time and also she needs to work more during summer.

Our background.

I ( Vraj ) am an international student who came to Canada in august 2019 and my sister (Nehi) came in December 2019. I am pursuing my masters of computer science at Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Ontario and my sister is pursuing a Bachelors of Commerce from the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon. I will graduate in May 2021 and my sister Nehi has a 4 years bachelors programme. She aspires to become a Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA)

The international tuition fee is 3 to 4 times the domestic tuition fee. For funding my education we had taken a loan without collateral (of course it has a higher interest rate than a loan with collateral) as it was easier for me to get a loan without security for a master's degree in computer science than bachelors of commerce ( which in India is not that well respected!)

I took a loan of ₹18,00,000. Which at that time in CAD was around $34,600. ( $24600 my first year's tuition fee + $10000 GIC, which is a requirement for student VISA). For my sister too we had taken a loan of 30,000 CAD. (20,000 Tuition Fee + 10,000 GIC)

I started working immediately and saved up my GIC + saved from my part-time earning towards my next year tuition fee. My sister did the same. Last year she worked 3 summer jobs as we knew we would need money. This summer she is working 2 summer jobs ( 1 full time for the summer + a part-time, so around 50-60 hours) along with 2 courses in the spring and 2 courses in the summer. Plus time commuting via bus, cooking her own meals and cleaning the house. She will have a very hectic spring+summer.

We both are working our best to save our tuition fee and helping each other as best as we can. I need immediate help for her summer 2021(CAD 4600) + fall 202(CAD 12,000) + winter 2022(CAD 12,000) tuition fee. 2 courses in summer 2021(July-august) + 5 in fall 2021 (September-December) + 5 winter (January-April). I am asking as our sponsor has some personal issues and can’t support us as promised. We can’t take another loan! The rest will go to future payments and/or her student loan repayment.

My father is earning around ₹60,000 - ₹75,000 (CAD 1000 - 1250) per month. And is supporting 6 members of our family. ( My father, mother, me, my sister, my grandfather and my grandmother He is already paying interest on my loan of ₹18,000 ( CAD 300) and of my sister ( CAD 200 ) per month. Half of his salary goes into paying that amount. We can’t borrow more as we can’t give anything more for collateral and my father is already not saving anything for emergency expenses. In India healthcare is privatized. In an emergency, it would be tough for our family. Like when my father was hospitalized because of COVID-19 this year. He has already undergone a heart valve replacement. I don’t want to stress him more.

Moreover by this December on both of our loan principal + interest payment will start. My father can’t pay both of our loan’s principal amount + interest. All my earnings would go toward that payment so it would be hard for me to save for my sister’s next year tuition fee.

The payment is around ₹30,000 for me and ₹24,000 for my sister. ( CAD 1000). So if my father pays that he won't have money left to keep food on the table. So I will support those monthly payments.

Nehi has always been an inquisitive child since the beginning. Be it studies, dancing, public speaking or leadership qualities. She has always tried to remain on the top. Over the years, she has developed a keen interest in studies and classical dancing as well.

Firstly, talking about the studies part, she completed her 12th Commerce by attaining an aggregate of 95.8% ( Maths-97 Accountancy-95 Business studies-97 Economics-98 English-92). In class 10th, she got 10 out of 10 CGPA. Not only 10th and 12th, since 1st grade, but she also has never achieved less than 90%. Well, that's a big achievement for her according to me. Coming to the extracurricular activities, she has always been practising classical dancing(Kathak) since she was 8 years old and currently is a professional Kathak dancer. Not only dancing, in school, but she has also shown several leadership qualities like becoming House Captain twice, Cultural Secretary, selected for several camps and competitions ( representing the school) all over the country, etc.

She is a bright student and I believe money should not come in one’s dream. She has proven records of excellence. But right now as we need the money she can’t give time to studies as much as she could. But I am proud of her as she is juggling more than full-time work along with studying 4 courses in spring and summer combined. Her dream was to get into SRCC India whose cut off was 98% and she missed it and was so upset. So we decided it is a good idea for studying undergrad in Canada. After my undergrad studies in India, I felt Canadian education would be better for her than Indian, especially for business/accounting. If we can’t pay the fees her dream of completing education would not be fulfilled. She is working and studying so hard. I don’t want her hopes to be shattered.

We both save money as much as possible. We both live in off-campus shared housing and cook our own meals. Using thrift stores whenever possible. She hardly saves anything with a 20-hour limit and $11.45 minimum wage during fall and winter terms. Her rent is $350 + utilities. She also has a phone bill + expenses for food. Whatever she saves could also be used for books and other education expenses. Plus we had other one time expenses like buying a laptop for study and used furniture for the house.

80 hours \* 11.50 = $920. ( the max she can earn per month during 8 months). And in winter the hours are reduced a bit too!

Money should not be a problem in today’s world. If someone is helping us we pledge that whenever we are able enough we would help someone in the same situation, after paying off all our student debts and completing studies. Right now we are helping others as best as we can. Any international students need temporary accommodation when they first come to Canada, we help them stay in our house. I believe that’s how the world can progress(helping others) more rapidly than ever! And because of the internet, we have hope.

I am proud of her as she came to a different country while she was just 18 and is living in a city where she did not know anyone before coming here. Please donate if you feel her struggle. Please consider the situation if your daughter or sister was in place of her! She is a bird, help her fly! We will update the proof of payment of the tuition fee. Let me know if you have other questions or need any other proofs.

134,"Hey! I've got a TON of questions, and I would appreciate some help.

I had applied to UofT St. George for Computer Science, and like many others, I was given an alternate offer to the Math and Physical Sciences Department. My question is not related to transferring to CS, but rather about UofT in general. I really want to explore my options in this department so I am not super worried about transferring to CS at the moment

So I have read in many places that UofT, especially St. George, is super competitive and it can be really depressing and hard to maintain good grades. I just wanted some opinions on this, since I really do not want my university life to be depressing. In case this information is useful, I did the IB program in high school, got a predicted score of 41/45 with HLs in Math, Physics and Economics (6,7,7 predicted scores respectively). Honestly, if the exams were to take place, I am 100% positive that I would have received at least a 41 score.

I know this might be a weird question but how hard would it be for someone like me at UofT in Math and Physical Sciences/CS??. How many students take more than 4 years to graduate (international tuition fees can be really expensive so I do not want to take more than 4 years). I know it would be hard to comment without knowing how much I am willing to work hard, but if it helps, the IB was stressful, but I did not find it THAT hard to manage and keep up with work and I did tons of other stuff outside of studies too.

Another thing that worries me is getting jobs after graduating. How hard is it for international students to get jobs in Toronto, and surely, if UofT is a very hard school to do well in, do most recruiters ""accept"" lower GPAs etc.?

137,"Hi there,  
I apologise if this is not the right place to ask this question, I've been looking around and I'm struggling to gauge what the answer might be here; could my boyfriend qualify for ODSP?  
I'm an international student living here in Canada currently and while I have enough money to provide for myself, I really do not have enough to also support my boyfriend who is a Canadian citizen born and raised here in Ontario.  
I live with him and his mom currently as a student, I pay her rent. She's not really a good person. Has abused him a lot growing up. But she offers me really low rent and honestly I can't afford to live anywhere else so we're both stuck here.  
She doesn't feed or provide for him in any way since he turned 18. Thankfully she doesn't charge him rent or expect money from him. If we eat dinner with her, she expects to be compensated (generously) afterwards, which I guess is fair. But I'm running out of money a lot quicker than originally planned.  


My boyfriend has pretty severe and crippling anxiety and MDD, diagnosed by a psychologist and GP. He had to leave his job in the Fall because it was a very toxic environment and making him suicidal. We haven't been able to find him a job since. Nor can I find one...   


I was raised to never look for handouts or abuse the system to take money from those who deserve it more from the government, but I feel like we need help pretty badly here. Neither of us have eaten anything in 4 days now and its going to be another two weeks before I get my next monthly allotment. His mom literally doesn't care. We could starve to death for all she cares.  


Sorry for going all into this sob story; I just wanted to give you all a honest view of our situation. I wouldn't be looking into ODSP for him unless we were desperate.  


I forgot to mention so far into this is that his mom is currently on ODSP, and I believe she is receiving additional money for him living under her (and possibly me too? even though I pay her under the table), I do not know if this disqualifies him from receiving income assistance himself. Even just to be able receive help in paying for him to continue seeing his psychologist would be greatly appreciated.

142,"I'm writing this on behalf of a friend who recently got diagnosed with ADHD, depression and anxiety. He has been prescribed Vyvanse as the first and most effective option and Concerta and Foquest as alternatives. 

MSP and Pharmacare do not currently cover Vyvanse and his medicines would cost him around $1500 per year. Since he's a university student, he wants to find the cheapest yet most effective option available. Concerta and Foquest are however, covered under insurance but as per what his doctor said and is written in his report, Vyvanse would suit his case the best and the other two options have unfavourable side effects.

A few questions I have are -
a. I know there's a provision under MSP that states that for those who are unable to get prescription drugs for themselves, can prove their financial condition and get it covered under MSP but how does one go about that? what does the process look like and how long does it take?

b. he's been told to start 20mg of Vyvanse per day and to increase dosage by 10mg every two weeks to a maximum of 60mg, as required. My friend does not have a physician and so he's not sure how he can go about getting his prescription dosage increased, if required. The clinic he got his diagnosis from is very slow and takes days and upto a week or more to reply and my freind wants to be able to get the meds as soon as possible. 

c. how do you actually get the prescription filled? do you just drop by a pharmacy and ask for it? does the diagnosis with the suggested medicines and doses count as a valid prescription?

143,"  To whom this may concern,

I know this situation might be stressful and there is a need for deliberation for the upcoming decisions that shall be made by the administration of the University of Calgary, and each decision along with Alberta Health Services’ recommendations will have a great impact on our community as a whole. Following WHO’s recommendations to limit the spread of COVID-19, as a student, I believe that it should be prudent for the university to proceed with the closure of the facilities and switch to online learning, however, the university has not yet decided to follow such recommendations from a world-renowned organization. 

As a student and part of the community, I am concerned about the decisions being made by the administration due to lack of assertiveness and close analysis of the situation as a whole and it is surprising that professors from this institution are the ones taking the matter with their own hands by canceling classes and providing different ways of examination and learning strategies while waiting for the university’s response. 

During these past days, I have felt worried and stressed about the progression of the virus in Alberta and as an international student, I cannot stress enough that I cannot afford to be sick, especially as a student with continuous examinations going on and the high costs of healthcare. Therefore, I urge the university to take action and proceed with the cancellation of in-person classes as I want to look out for my integrity and the integrity of our community.

I should mention that I suffer from depression sometimes and being in quarantine hasn't helped with that. The way my state and the US has handled COVID-19 also makes me want to go elsewhere.

I could go to another university in my state for a very cheap overall cost, but it is considered socially dead. I've visited recently and am not sure if I would like it; I'm worried it will make my depression worse. I also have no family I talk to in this state besides my parents, so it is quite lonely and there are not many people who I can relate to.

I also have the option of going to a private university out of state, but that will cost me significantly more. This would be located in a place I've considered living in \[in the future\] and with more people of my demographic.

My third option would be becoming an international student. I am considering Australia as I mentioned earlier. An important note is that my boyfriend lives there and I haven't seen him in 6 months, which has drained my mental health. The only issue is that the tuition for an international student is expensive. Other than that, there are a lot of people of my demographic and I could see myself enjoying life more.

What I'm mainly concerned about is my mental health and the effect of me staying somewhere that I don't want to be. Additionally, I'm unsure whether a \[Comp Sci\] degree in the US or another country such as Australia or Canada would be better to pursue.

147,"**Winter term will be online: Provost's letter**

Dear Members of the McMaster community, While the fall term is only in its second week I want to update our campus community on the planning being done for the winter 2021 term.  I have been leading a group with broad representation of academic and campus leaders who evaluated many options for the winter term. The President and Vice-Presidents (PVP) have accepted the group's recommendation that McMaster extends this fall's online delivery of academic programs into the winter term. I realize that this will be disappointing to many.  For those of you who are used to being on campus and interacting with colleagues, peers and students in person, the virtual environment presents additional challenges. For those of you who, like me, are new to McMaster, I understand the difficulties with building relationships and negotiating through our University virtually.  McMaster remains committed to making decisions based on the health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff.  Every level of public health continues to stress the need to maintain physical distancing and anticipates the pandemic continuing for the foreseeable future.  To keep our community as safe as possible, the winter academic term will be online with only a few exceptions where program requirements or the need for access to specialized equipment or facilities may still require some in-person campus time.

* Classes for the entire winter term will be online.
* With few exceptions, students will not need to be on campus to take courses. Students enrolling in programs with an on-campus component will receive additional information directly from their departments.
* Faculty and staff are encouraged to continue to find alternate, online means to deliver programs.
* The process used for the fall term to request use of labs and other specialized facilities, where essential to meet program requirements, will continue to be used with requests requiring approval from the Department Chair, Dean and the Provost or delegate.
* Residences will remain closed but will continue to provide accommodation in exceptional circumstances and to support international students or others who need to quarantine
* Decisions regarding research at the university will continue to be determined under the leadership of the Vice-President, Research

We recognize that COVID-19 has added an additional level of stress for many students, faculty and staff.  By making the decision about the winter 2021 term as early as possible, we hope to provide as much stability as we can in what is a dynamic and unpredictable pandemic. We will continue to work closely with public health officials to monitor the pandemic and make the most informed decisions possible for the university.  

We encourage everyone to reach out for any assistance they may need whether it is through the Student Wellness Centre or through employee support programs. This is particularly important for students who may be finding the online environment challenging.  Please do not hesitate to speak to your professors or others in your department or Faculty or, for first year students, your Archway coaches and mentors.  

Even in a normal year the beginning of term tends to bring with it some technical glitches no matter how much preparation and planning is done.  We are establishing a new group to help to ensure we are in the strongest position to address all of these issues and to continue to share solutions and best practices across campus.  Co-chaired by the deans of Engineering and Social Sciences, the Virtual Learning Task Force will bring together the MacPherson Institute, technology experts and others to support the best possible online learning experience. 

There are many questions that will still need to be answered and we will continue to share information and decisions as they are made.  Please continue to check in regularly with the Daily News  and McMaster's COVID-19 website for updates and information on services and supports. Thank you to you all as we continue to face the pandemic together.

Sincerely,Susan Tighe, Provost &amp; Vice-President (Academic)

My questions:
1) Do you think working 15hrs/week is too much? Is 10hrs/week okay?
2) How stressful are these graduate teaching assistantship jobs? What are we expected to do?
3) As an international students, are there other fundings opportunities I can apply between now and the start of the semester?
4) unrelated question: As a grad student can I take/audit some advanced level undergrad maths courses?

149,"Hi everyone,

I am starting to get extremely alarmed by the magnitude of students struggling with mental health issues this semester, whether it be stress, anxiety, lack of motivation, depression, substance use, feeling generally shitty, or anything else that could be caused or exacerbated by online school in a pandemic. 

I don't think that the university does enough to advertise the mental health support it offers students, but there are resources available. If you feel like you are struggling, even a little bit, please sit down and chat about it with someone. Family, friends, or any of the resources below. You are not alone. You are not weak for struggling.  There are many many people struggling just as much as you. The Carleton discord server has tons of people who would be willing to hop on voice chat for a conversation about mental well-being, myself included. With the winter, cold weather, and exams approaching, stress and poor mental health is only going to get worse unless you get help.

Below is every resource I could find that the university offers for mental health. If you have anymore, please post a comment below and I will add it to the list.

150,"COVID 19 has fundamentally changed the way our lives used to progress. The many lockdowns, an increasing number of infections, shut down of educational institutions, cancellation of internships, have resulted in uncertainty and anxiety about how the future is going to unravel. Students preparing for the GRE examination and planning their higher studies abroad are no exception. With international flight operations suspended in India for the time being and uncertainties about visa processes, admissions to different universities due to lockdowns, aspirants are confused about how to go forward with GRE prep and [GRE classes](https://www.courses.catking.in/gre-courses/). 

# Proactive Response to the Crisis

However, it is not all bad news. ETS, the conducting body for GRE Exam, has recently announced that test-takers can now appear for the exams online in a proctored format. The GRE pattern remains identical to the GRE General Test taken at a test center as also the Total marks, GRE Exam duration, content, and on-screen experience.

In addition to that, Canada has declared that international students will be exempt from the travel restrictions if they have a valid study permit or were approved for a study permit on or before 18th March 2020. The start of Autumn/Fall 2020 intake of international degree programs at major popular international student destinations like the US, Germany, and Europe will be conducted online, either partially or fully. Besides these, colleges are also trying to lessen the burden of students by allowing them to pay their tuition fees in installments.

Thus, while the world and education pattern as we know now will undergo a fundamental shift as a result of this pandemic, MS or MBA from a world-renowned university will continue to remain a huge career springboard.

151,"Excuse the Wall of text, kinda just demonstrates my frustration. 

**Backstory**: 4th year here.. I never really liked this place lol. I'm gonna be honest and just say it how it is. I got into this school because I was a complete hermit in high school and got good grades, didn't have a life, but I was never the type of person who's studious and enjoys this type of BS. My parents kinda forced it on me and I was struggling a lot.

So I came here as an international student (no, not from India, China or HK lol) and thought I'd finally be free on my own and have a good time. I did hear a lot of not-so-great stories about UofT and the life here, but it didn't phase me much and decided to give it a shot to see for myself.

So I gave it my all into becoming the person I really felt like I was and wanted to be, but..

It didn't take me long (3 days into frosh) to realize I didn't like or fit in with this place. But I already had no way out and just kept at it.. For my first few months of freshman year I was a part of a frat, I later left because I didn't like it and was doing bad in school. Then I had no life for a while, like maybe a year, but I didn't care cuz that was basically the same as high school lol. A while later I got fed up and just started doing crazy things, meeting people in the city, had tons of fun, yet failed a year.. so I came back focused and having no life again. The only thing I'm focusing on right now is coming to class, obsessing over doing my work to the best I can, and leaving. I don't care about anything else.

But anyway, I just can't help but sometimes think that I wanna do things with people, not so much 'friends' because I honestly don't like this city or university, but more so like a partner to be able to share things with and de-stress. Idk I just feel that way when I was with someone before. 

It's just so hard though, like I feel that I'm not attracted to most girls I come across, and even when I do, I feel like we're not so much on the same frequency personality/interest wise.. 

\-----

**Main story**: And on other occasions, I sometimes see a girl I might like or be attracted to, but I don't know how she's like. (Keep in mind this is like 5-10% of the time, once in a blue moon i.e. 1-2 years). But I feel like she would be unapproachable and it never amounts to anything. But it doesn't surprise me. Like I feel like these types of girls, or even people in general, might probably feel the same way about this place, that they just are probably fed up and don't want anything more than coming to class and leaving.

During my time here I'm literally just gonna say I saw 5 girls I've been attracted to, 2 in 1st year, 2 in 3rd year, and 1 in 4th year. The current one who sits literally 2 seats away from me on the same row always, she comes into class as soon as it starts, leaves in between breaks, and is usually gone 20 minutes before class is over, and that happened to be the trend with the rest.. 

I used to try harder as a freshman with these things but as time went by I just gave up and stopped caring lol, although last year for instance, during a summer course, I put a ton of effort into getting this girl's attention. I was **desperate** to pass but I just couldn't resist and wanted a thing with her, to the point where I slacked (but luckily ended up passing) as I started to obsess over trying to get her attention. I noticed she was wearing a certain piece of designer clothing and figured she might be into that stuff, so I took the time to come to class dressed similar and possibly bringing up a conversation with her about that. I would be sitting in class for a whole 2 hours barely even paying attention but just trying to 'seize the opportunity', which never came, and she'd be the same way in that she comes late, earphones in breaks, leaves early and the class doesn't allow much discussion either.. I gave up.

Now with the current one it's kinda similar. I noticed she's sporting a designer item and so I tried to take the time to dress well for next class in hopes of striking up a conversation/using it as an ice-breaker, but she came to class late, and for about 30 minutes and left when there was 1h30 left. I didn't even bother anymore as I was used to it at this point lol.

So yea.. that's that. Feel free to give your inputs.",0.0

Thus in this blog, we would try to explain with statistics and valid reasons, how Canada and its government plans to overcome this post Covid-19 crisis by benefitting immigrants from all across the world. 

IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON CANADA

ROLE OF IMMIGRANTS TO HELP CANADA RECOVER FROM THE POST COVID-19 IMPACT

a) Alone immigrants can promote economic growth in Canada.

b) Immigration also boosts population growth in Canada since the 1990s.

c) Immigrants’ entrepreneurs will create new jobs and business opportunities in the Canadian market.

d) Immigrants get energy, skills, and new ideas to Canada. Most importantly, they pay their taxes. 

e) Immigration is helping Canada to get the best food, fuel and health supplies.

INITIATIVES BY CANADIAN GOVERNMENT TO BOOST IMMIGRATION OF THE COUNTRY, POST COVID-19

a) Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship of Canada (IRCC) is improvising its Global Case Management System digitally to shorten immigration process with lesser paper work. This includes an investment of $72 million by the Canada government.

b) IRCC plans to spend $750 million for Canada immigration 2021 – 2026. 

c) Increase skill labour welcome through Express Entry. 5000 permanent resident invitation issued in one Express Entry after Covid-19 is by far the largest recorded among Express Entry, Canada statistics. 

d) Creating more job opportunities for immigrants by minimizing social distance and travel restriction norms. 

e) IRCC reformed the Post-Graduation Work Permit for international students. Now it makes international students attending online classes eligible for PGWP.

f) Greater issuance of permanent residence status for immigrant migrant workers to recognize their contributions during Covid-19 in Canada.

Hello, I will pre-warn you, this is lengthy, I have tried very hard to condense this and remain calm, I apologize if I become emotional, but I am highly distressed at this time. 

I am in my mid-30s and my partner is in her early 30s we are both females, and I am an international student in Ontario Canada... 

To start, around 2014 - back home - I had a discectomy of the L4/L5. The operation gave me back my life, and allowed me to walk without pain. In August 2018, I fell out of a U-Haul truck here in Canada, and was taken to the hospital to have my leg x rayed for breaks. I was given morphine in the ambulance, which in hindsight, masked symptoms of pain. I thought the issue was with my leg, but no breaks were found, I was sent home on crutches, and told to be off of within three weeks. 

After a short time period, my back displayed symptoms similar to what I had experienced with my first prolapsed disc, but this time on the opposite side. I asked my doctor about the pain, and I was told I should seek physio, she also said that she would be unable to prescribe pain relief as "" some people become addicted to pain killers"". 

For the record, the first time a disc slipped in my back, I was prescribed diclofenac and co-dydramol, - to cope with the pain. During the after-care of my first operation, I was given Ora-morph for a week. After recovery, I removed all pain medication from my life and was happy to do so!

January 2019 began with severe pain, and I commenced my physio... The pain began to affect my studies, and without any pain relief I was unable to sit or stand for the duration of lessons in class, I mainly found myself lying on my front, on the floor in the desperation of finding some relief... I was unable to drive to lessons - thankfully I had the full support of my college, and they helped me to get through my studies with accommodation - however, I spent a majority of my year lying on the floor, in tears using Tylenol, Advil, and Cannabis to cope with the pain. 

I corresponded with my doctor throughout this, with no real assistance (she was a three-hour drive from my location -we had moved location to be near my college - I do not understand how the system fully works here, so I thought it might be best to stay with the same doctor, as up until this point, she had **appeared** to be a good doctor). 

Meanwhile, my partner (who has ADHD) was prescribed Adderall by our doctor in the first year (2016) we arrived in Canada. In the time that we had been with this doctor - who prescribed the Adderall for my partner – my partner’s blood pressure was taken maybe once? But no more, even though my partner was required to visit our doctor for a refill in prescription, **every 3 months**. - Please note, that the doctor was aware of my partner's history included heart problems within her family, this is for later reference!

Back to me, I went to a physio appointment, where the physio lay me on a bed, placed a strap around the bed, she knelt at the end of the bed, and tied the strap around herself, grabbed my legs, and began to lean back while pulling my leg? **At this point, I felt a sharp pain in my groin, told the physio** and finished my appointment. The next day **I began to see ""spotting"" of urine,** this slowly became more substantial, and so I visited my doctor for advice. The physio had no access to an MRI scan, before she began pulling me about. In my home country, my physio told me that they would not work with me until I had an MRI scan to show them what the damage was?

The first time I had a prolapsed disc - in home country - medical professional had told me that ""if I began to have bladder or bowel control issues, the decision to have the operation on my back would be out of my hands, and I would be rushed into the hospital immediately"", so aware of this information, I was concerned. 

My Doctor rubbed her hand around the base of my back - I assume to see if I still had sensitivity in this area (which I did)? - and then said, ""the **sudden urine incontinence** was due to anxiety""? So no connection to what the physio had done? Purely a coincidence????????????????. I again asked about pain medication, which she said:"" she did not believe in pain medication, and ‘as someone who had experienced a back injury herself thought I would be fine and recover"". 

Please, let me again express that on a scale of 1 to 10 (which at no point I was ever asked by my doctor): - 1 being no pain, 10 being excruciating pain - I was at a 9 most days. I was crying my eyes out, scared, alone without support, now put into a position to worry about my college studies which I had invested so much time and money into, and the fact that I could not find any part-time employment because I could barely move.

Everything was placed onto my partner, which was extremely stressful for her, and I became increasingly depressed! (I already experience depression, but prior to this incident, I was doing really well as far as my mental state!).

For the record, I am a "" hardy person""! I have seen a lot in my life and was a childcarer to a parent. I had studied at one point as a nurse until I hurt my back and was told I had to stop my studies. I am **not** lazy, or unmotivated!!!... I have family members who work within the emergency services at many levels: breadth and depth of these services, including the police force and health services, and I respect most individuals within these professions... I do not take them for granted, I respect the law and I do not seek to waste their time, and most of my life I have avoided using up resources if it is something I can manage on my own - with regard to my health- I want to make this clear, because in the last year alone, here in Canada, I have been made to feel like I am hysterical, and that most of this is in my head for attention. 

Back to my partner, my partner found a lump on her breast, and so informed our Doctor who referred her to the appropriate departments for examination, during the examination they had an ""incidental find""... her breast was fine, but a shadow had been seen on/near to her heart... she was sent for further scans of the shadow.... and when the results came back, our Doctor told us that she had something on her heart, ""could have possibly always been there, nothing to worry about, I'm sure you'll be fine!"" and 'said' that she would refer my partner to a specialist...

Our Doctor told us -around July 2019 that she would be retiring in Sep 2019, and advised we found a new doctor (never before did she suggest this) we began seeking new doctors closer to our location.

My partner waited months with no feedback, no letter or phone call. but on her next visit to the doctor for more Adderall, the doctor took her blood pressure because of the new incidental find, and it was high! She told her to wear a 24-hour ambulatory heart monitor, which my partner would have to locate a clinic herself and organize the whole test on her own. 

When the results came back, our doctor immediately prescribed her medication for hypertension, was told to start taking the tablets and that she had hypertension over the phone. She was not even brought into the office to sit down and discuss this properly with my partner. My partner took the prescription to the pharmacist, who advised my partner that “she should have blood tests completed before taking the medication”. 

As you may imagine, my partner was extremely worried about what to do at this point, so she reached out to our Doctor to tell her she had been advised to have blood tests done, and directly asked the doctor if she could send my partner for the blood tests. 

The doctor’s response was that the “last set of blood tests that were done - (over two years prior to this moment in time) - showed she was fine, and that she could ask the new doctor (whenever we got one) to redo blood tests”

Back to me: I was increasingly worsening with pain, and my bladder incontinence had also increased. I was now using sanitary towels to contain my newly humiliating, and worrying symptoms. I decided to get in writing, confirmation from the doctor regarding my bladder incontinence. I wrote to her to say that I was becoming increasingly depressed and that I was very worried about having bladder incontinence since the physio had pulled on my back?

She had a complete change in attitude when I wrote to her, she emailed back told me to visit a hospital and get an MRI scan... no referral for the MRI scan... I was to - as a random joe - obtain an MRI scan on my own. 

I went to the first hospital, they assessed me -which was not comfortable at all-  and said It didn't seem like the symptoms matched with ""cortao equine syndrome"", they sent me away and my doctor would need to refer me. Imagine the embarrassment of reciting your symptoms, the situation, having to recount almost a year of humiliation, trauma, and pain, to have medical professionals look at you like you are mad for seeking an MRI, I told them it was requested by my doctor to come to the hospital?! 

I relayed the information in writing to my doctor… She now offered an email I could provide to the hospital that said she was ""suddenly worried for me, and that she suspected I might have ""cortao equina syndrome"", she now gave me a doctor’s note to take to the hospital, to have the MRI scan and gave me a specific hospital to visit. 

So, with the doctor's note, I went to the new hospital... I had my MRI, which showed a newly prolapsed disc (l3/l4) but was told that they couldn’t see any signs of cortao equine syndrome, HOWEVER, it may not have shown on the MRI scan, and the doctor on duty suggested that my doctor should send me to a urologist for further investigation into what was wrong with my bladder incontinence? 

I relayed this information to my doctor, who said that my new doctor could arrange this for me.

I responded saying that the waiting time would be two months for a meet and greet with my new doctor.

My old doctor told me that this was a “reasonable amount of time to wait to see a new doctor” and that was the end of that.. I was left to cope in that situation until I got to see a new doctor.

That was the last contact I had with my old doctor! We felt so disheartened and depressed and unsupported and worried for both my partner and myself, we didn’t know what to do. 

my partner decided that while waiting for a new doctor, she would go to a walk-in clinic if her symptoms deteriorated to see if they could do anything, while we waited for the new doctor to see us. Just so she had some form of support.

In this time of waiting for a new doctor, I began to have chest pains, they were like pins and needles over my whole chest, sometimes significantly located in one area I would have a concentrated pain near my heart… and at one point I felt a massive ‘pop’ pain in the right side of my chest that made me grab onto the kitchen side. 

  
I went to Emergency at the hospital that took care of me, they did blood tests and an ECG (i think it was called that)? Chest x ray, and ultrasound….as well as check my blood pressure and oxygen, they told me that my bp was high, but I hadn’t had a heart attack, and couldn’t see anything on the initial tests. They told me to speak with my Doctor “as there may be an underlying issue that might need investigating”.

So at my meet and greet with my doctor, I began to ‘rehash’ everything the last year had been for me, and I began to cry a lot, my BP was still high, and she said that it sounded like a panic attack?  
When did crying mean panicking!!???!!!!!  I had been through, yet MORE trauma that was completely unnecessary!!! But I was not panicking, just sad that I felt so unsupported and in so much pain, and worry about myself and my partner, You can worry without panicking!!!  
 

I was skeptical (because growing up, I have experienced a variety of sensations revolving around panic attacks) but I put my faith in her.  We talked about pain medication, and what my last doctor had said as to why she refused me pain medication, and the new doctor said “but there are so many options now, other than opioids that can help with pain” she put me on an anti-anxiety medication, and I did experience a big relief in pain, which went down to about a 6 - 5 on good days. I could still use Tylenol, and Advil, … however it occurred that the Advil might be one reason for my high BP, so I stopped taking it, and have since refused to use it…I also rotate heat packs and ice packs… and use a tense unit.

Now I was left with a defined thumping sensation in my chest, that seems to flare up on occasion and landed me back in emergency a number of times, this whole experience has broken my mental health and spirit, not so much panic attacks, but definitely feeling hopeless, and to sum it up (excuse my French) pretty much fucking destroyed as a human being, and as a woman. I don’t even feel like an animal at this point!

My new doctor “referred” me to a neurologist (well that’s what I called them back home) and the person that I never met, looked at my MRI and reported back to my doctor that I am not a candidate for surgery… I have been suggested a physio, but I am so afraid to go in case I am pulled around and more damage is created.

I had to go to the walk-in clinic at my new doctor's, to report pins and needles in my hands and feet, the doctor said they would have tests done, and that I should get Vitamin B and D supplements, so I did. The pins and needles have diminished, but I still get it every now and then in my feet…

I have been told I have a prolapsed pelvis by my doctor who hasn’t done any examination to confirm this? and to see a pelvis physio alongside a normal physio (I'm not sure where I am supposed to get the money for this, I do have insurance, but I have to pay first and claim back later, and I haven’t got the money to spend for all this stuff as a student?),  the doctor hasn't consider a urologist referral, and I told her that’s what the hospital doctor said I should do?

As for what is going on with my heart, It dawned on me that maybe my hiatal hernia might be causing these extreme symptoms, and stress on my heart? My last appointment with my doctor was just before Christmas 2019… I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes to see her, I told her I didn’t think the chest issues were panic attacks, I thought it might be hiatal hernia and not a panic attack? I emphasized that I truly did not think it felt like a panic attack (36 years with my own body, I might know some things about how I feel and think???) (Also I was being woken up by the sensation, so how could it be a panic attack, plus she didn't ask questions to lead her to the diagnosis of a panic attack?)

The doctor replied – who seemed offended that I politely challenged her diagnosis of panic attack- that “ if it was hiatial hernia, it would have ""more sick and food coming up in my throat” (I live with the condition, not the textbook definition… I have had previous experiences of heartburn because of the hiatal hernia, that were debilitating, but no bile, no food in my throat?). She said she would ‘take a look at my blood tests, prescribed me an anti-inflammatory for my heart (more pills without really knowing what the hell is going on with me??) and said in a nonchalant slightly ‘humpy’ manner that maybe exercise would help…… then left the room, no follow up appointment. I sat there, lost thinking ""well what do I do now?""

**Plllleeeeeeasssseeeeee tell me…. Hoooww** I am supposed to exercise without knowing if I am at risk of hurting myself if I increase my heart rate? How am I supposed to exercise when I walk with a god damn cane? (I do walk, but slowly because the pain is so bad). Also, the year I spent on the floor unable to move, was beyond my control!!!!!!!!!! So how is all of this being dismissed as a coincidence? How am i only being taken at ""face value"" to her assumptions of my story, and how i am in the position i face today? To this point, my doctor has not discussed my ACE score, or my medical history, including mental well-being, but has made a bunch of assumptions and come to a destination of sending me for blood tests, and more tests, and expensive services, and pills, after pills, after pills??????????

 The message I am getting from this? 

Even a female doctor has taken one look at me, saw me as an overweight, gay, sensitive female, and translated that as a hysterical, and fat, and concluded this is why I have all the problems I face today? That’s the b-all-and-end-all of my problems? I do not deserve anymore support?

NOT that before the fall from the U-Haul I was a relatively healthy woman, happy, and physically able to do so much with a lot more confidence than I have now!!!! 

Not as someone who has been through - what I feel - has been neglect on many occasions, and amplified the distress I have gone through! That being told I am having panic attacks, and implying ""its all in my head"" when something feels very physically wrong and different from how my body felt before all of this happened, makes me stressed and is making me feel ashamed, and frightened, and traumatized!?

Oh and the doctor has me fill out a survey before every appointment to rate my mental state, which is triggering in itself because I have to be mindful of how I have been feeling, and I feel like crap, so that makes me sad right before the appointment, so of course I'm tearful! Last year I had full control of my bladder, and now I have lost so much confidence!

  
Not that I am an international student pumping a solid amount of funding into a country, where I thought I would find adventure and enjoy learning new skills that I could use in my future life… Which as a dream, I feel is slowly wilting away…?

But nope, this will not be investigated either, so I am living with worry about what the hell is going on with my bladder, my back, my heart, while finishing college, in a different country… from my family … 

My partner, has had to reach out for the second time to the new doctor to find out where her appointment is for the cardiologist specialist because they haven’t got back to her about this? It's now been over 8 months since this incidental find on her heart, and this is how long it's taking to further discover what it might be????????????

 I feel like we have no rights at this time, I have no clue if I can seek legal advice if I should reach out to my embassy? or even how to go about complaining, it's so hard to find information online?   
Right now I am hopeless and at a loss...  


Please would anyone be able to provide any information/advice / or anything in the way of the direction I should go from here?   
We feel like we have no control over our lives right now!?!?!",0.0
159,"Hi all, I am an international student who finished 3rd year and is doing PEY since May. Therefore, I hold a co-op work permit and a student visa. I will also take a course second semester which will be online.

The reason I am mentioning this is because I am thinking of going to my home country for Christmas. I haven't been home since last January and nobody from home could visit me either. I am thinking of leaving around Dec 18 and coming back around January 8th. My job is WFH and I have good holiday benefits so might as well use that. 

However, with Covid situation, I have a few concerns:

1) Has anyone had any problems leaving and returning to Canada with their co-op permit? What kind of problems did you face?

2) How was flying in and out of the country like? What kind of preparation did you do - especially for the mandatory quarantine in Canada? Did you have any issues with the permit(s) you hold?

3) Is it a senseless idea to leave and come back during Christmas period? I am concerned Christmas could see a lot of people going around, and it might force Canada (and other countries) to close their border. 

4) If I do not go back for Christmas, what would you suggest I could do in Toronto/ Canada? I live alone and it seems like most of my friends will be going back to their homes/ spending Christmas with their family. It would be rude to ask them to invite me.

Side-note: Before anyone judges me for thinking about leaving, I wanted to give some background info. Since around march, I have been all alone and it was brutal. I was suffering from depression March-May because of covid + some other personal problems. Now, I am not depressed anymore, though I can feel very bleak from time to time. I am irreligious so Christmas doesn't hold any important value, however, my family did have a New Year meal every year. What I'm most concerned is that Christmas is a whole week off from work, and most of my friends in Toronto are going back (somewhere). The city would be quite empty (like it was during Thanksgiving) and without anyone, I could end up feeling the way I did in March-May. I looked up other possible ideas I could do - maybe rent a place a bit out of the city with 1-2 friends - and I was really surprised that plane tickets were much cheaper than having a ""holiday"" with friends during Christmas. I guess prices are just much higher during Christmas. 

Also, even if I do not go back for Christmas, I do have an intention to go back late spring-summer and spend a few months back home. I do not think covid will be as bad and my country's response has been much better than that of Canada. The reason I wouldn't go back home now for a few months is because I will be taking a course and I have some extracurriculars. It would just be hard to manage all with a time difference and worse internet. (Also due to other reasons I will not mention here)",0.0

I am a 26-year-old male, Canadian citizen, with a BFA in dance from a liberal arts college in NYC. I've always been keen on education and specifically returning to school after my Bachelor's. I feel like I am on the pathway to figuring out what I would like to study but I am also very lost.

To provide some context, I am attended school in NYC from 2014-2018, during that time I struggled a lot with my mental health (anxiety, depression, bulimia). Unfortunately, the dance world was too overwhelming for me at the time, and it did not seem like a career that I have fully invested in anymore. I then had to return to Canada summer of 2019 due to the end of my student visa, and since then I've spent almost every day thinking about getting back on track and discovering myself again.

I struggle with weighing my desires and dream life, and also considering the practicality of it all, especially amidst Covid restrictions. I am firm in that I would like to return to school in NYC—it's pretty much my home and where I feel most myself. Beyond that, I have little idea about what I would like to study. At first, I wanted to backtrack and complete a PostBacc so that I could move into the Nutrition &amp; Dietetics field, which stemmed from my past with eating disorders and my drive to be a person to help those in need as I didn't receive that help when I needed it most and to also challenge my brain in a different way than I had used it during my undergrad. I realized that backtracking to fulfill the academic courses, whether in Canada or the US, requires me either finishing high school level courses in Canada and then moving to college/university level courses, or following the international student requirement PostBacc in the US in only one year. At that point, I realized my passion for the subject wasn't fully present, and that the urge to move into sciences came from low self-esteem as my BFA is often viewed as worthless.

Since then, I've been attempting to do a lot of introspective work, which may also be a disadvantage because I am constantly in my head, to figure out my values, goals, desires, interests, etc. As much as I've been focusing on the things that I don't like or may not seem suitable for me, here are some **things I do know**:

* I am queer and I would like to study/work in a space that allows me to investigate the insections of queerness in today's society
* I am mixed race. I am Black and Japanese and I am interested in incorporating my background as a part of my studies and further into the political and social climate right now
* I am creative- as much as I've moved away from my dreams of performing, I am still a creative-minded person. I would love to work with dancers, movers, other likeminded people
* I am interested in fashion, specifically fashion marketing. I would love to study something along the lines of fashion marketing that includes an emphasis on race, inclusivity of models (dancers)

I have other interests, but I guess those are my main focuses right now. With my job history since graduation including working in the admin fitness industry and short-lived receptionist jobs, I have little work experience that would suffice for a grad school application.

TLDR; I guess I'm wondering, how can I figure out my passions and what to study in grad school considering the pandemic and being an international student determined to live in NYC

Thank you to anyone who has made it this far

163,"Ok so I've finished my first year and just got into PoST and I just wanna give my personal opinion of UofT. I am ready to take all criticisms but I'm trying to be realistic. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. UOFT ISN'T AS HARD AS WHAT PEOPLE SAY. I don't find UofT particularly harder than any other unis. I have friends in the states and when I see their assignments and tests, it's definitely similar to our level if not, harder. I'm going to be real here, UofT is known to be hard because there are so many people that would DROP OUT of the school and say UofT is a hard school. With this issue specifically, I think it's all about the admissions. UofT has approx. 25k freshers every year. And I see that there are 5k students graduating annually. That is 20% of the freshers and you may be wondering wheres the 80%. Let me tell you. They are either retaking courses, dropped out of school, or possibly taking gap year for PEY/internship/ or simply taking a rest( I really respect the upper years doing this but this is very minimal amount). I'll be fair and assume 10% of the 80% are doing PEY/internship/resting. So what's up with that 70%? I had a discussion with couple of friends and we all came up with the same answer that those 70% didn't deserve to be in UofT at first. They simply came for the name value. UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, one of the best uni in Canada so people would just come here and find themselves so proud to be part of the community. 
2. PEOPLE THAT CANT SPEAK ENGLISH HERE. I'm not trying to be racist or anything (I'm international too) but there are many international students that are here and can't speak english(mostly Chinese and Koreans). I heard that the distribution of international students' cgpa is roughly populated at 2.0 \~ 2.5. Without a doubt, there are many smart international students out here acing every tests and maintaining a high cgpa. But especially with my MAT135 and 136, I saw people struggling with high school maths like simple differentiation. I was also told by one of my Chinese friend that he has bunch of friends that would use GOOGLE TRANSLATE and do their tests because they simply can't understand english. Like come on people why are you guys here in the first place if you can't speak english. 
3. AP IS HARDER THAN UOFT. Might be my personal thoughts but as a person who took AP and got 3 5s and 2 4s, I wasn't as stressed as I was in hs. I took AP Calculus and I got a 5. I took MAT135 and MAT136 and this was the easiest 4.0 I can say. I might be wrong here so don't take my words. I think the time we have to study and chill in uni &gt; time in hs. I really didn't have much time to play games during ap but in uni I'm out spending 3-4 hours a day playing games and still surviving with a decent cgpa. 
4. STOP WHINING ABOUT HARD EXAMS. University is supposed to be hard and challenging. It requires depth understanding and critical thinking. It was you that chose the prestigious uni that can be harder than some other unis so take it to the chin and deal with it. And most importantly, everyone can survive uoft if you all do the basics. Attend the lecture, write down the notes, read the textbook, attend office hours, do the questions(from textbook, tutorials, lecture, maybe past exams) and if you can't find one search it up! there are loads of questions in google. It's just those people that aren't doing the basic agendas as a student and complaining uoft is hard.
5. HIGH CGPA DEFINITELY REQUIRES HARD WORK. I believed I have studied quite hard in my first year and did receive a satisfying cgpa. But I am also aware that my cgpa will significantly drop in next 3 years. Courses definitely get harder as you take higher year courses meaning managing your cgpa is going to be really hard. Also, one mistake can make a big change in your cgpa. I have a friend that got 80s in most courses except one where he got a 57. This got him a 3.0 cgpa which I believe is unfair but it's not like he's going to fail graduating or get an academic suspension.",0.0

On my YT channel and FB group I give motivational talks and bring to light other issues like - being a mature student, struggling with things like weight gain, acne while studying for these exams, and of course memory tricks and other study stuff. 

I know maybe, your reading this and thinking 'well she has not even done her mcq yet' which is true, but I am in the process, and I feel my videos could help ANY pharmacy student (including Canadian students), in fact since starting my fb, I had a few Waterloo and U of T students reach out to me because unfortunately they failed the PEBC exam). So yeah...

Of course there are youtube videos that address these issues but I felt like .... nothing specific because this super niche. 

And I find that .... so many of these threads and forums are dead like people posting from two years ago....so I wanted to create something to help students out there especially REPEAT test takers and give them hope.

**A bit of background**: 

(I am currently preparing for the PEBC Qualifying Examination. Before I was eligible to do Qualifying I actually had to do the Evaluating Exam for international students lol). 

**My story**: (This is a post I initially made that went viral on one of the Evaluating Examination threads on fb). 

A brief background, I am a Indian-Canadian born here, did a bachelor's degree in Canada. Originally I wanted to do medical school and completely messed up the MCAT. I changed gears to pharmacy, and got rejected for 3 years in a row after applying to all the schools in Canada, so I ended up going to England to do my pharmacy degree. 

I was one of the older students in my class because everyone in England starts pharmacy when they are 18/19 and I was coming after a bachelor's. 

In England, in my final year of pharmacy, I failed a module. I was told, I would have to repeat the entire year (I was supposed to graduate in 2018 but ended up graduating in 2019). My pharmacy school in England informed me, they could only give me one more attempt on the module, after that, if I failed again, there was nothing they could do and I might be going home to Canada after 5 years with no pharmacy degree. 

I was under IMMENSE PRESSURE. 

By god's grace I graduated with my pharmacy degree in May of 2019. 

Then I started looking at EVALUATING EXAM PEBC and realized becoming a licensed pharmacist in Canada is a completely different ball game. I was overwhelmed when I saw misbah's book of notes for the first time. 

My first attempt of the exam was in Jan of 2020 and I failed. I got super depressed and starting questioning my whole life, is pharmacy even for me? Am I smart enough to pass? Maybe I am just not cut out for this. I got super, super depressed. I had to pick myself up and work very, very, very hard. I attempted the Evaluating exam for a second time in Jan 2021, after one year of preparation and I passed with the grace of god. 

My purpose for writing this post is to tell those people out there...not to give up, it is possible and it is doable. Yes, it is very, very hard. I did my pharmacy training from England and found Evaluating a completely different ball game. You will have hard days, you will have days you want to give up and quit. You will have days you doubt the whole process and doubt yourself, KEEP GOING. THIS IS NORMAL AND PART OF THE PROCESS. 

I quit my job and made studying for evaluating a full-time job. 

READ THE PEBC EVALUATING BREAKDOWN ON THEIR WEBSITE SO YOU KNOW WHERE TO FOCUS YOUR TIME\*\*\*Sources I used:

\-Misbah

\-Pharmachieve

\-YouTube Videos \*\* Do not underestimate these, this is powerful

\-My own research (hours on google reading medical texts, pharmacy texts, etc). 

At the end of the day, I found one course was not enough for me. There are topics I liked from misbah more than pharmachieve. There are topics I liked in pharmachieve more than misbah. Some people are ok to take one course, for me, it was not enough. 

THIS IS NOT ABOUT STUDYING OR MATERIAL - THIS IS A MENTAL GAME - YES IT IS A LOT OF MATERIAL BUT IT IS DOABLE. DO NOT BE AFRAID, TAKE YOUR TIME ON EACH TOPIC AND LEARN THOROUGHLY. I made this exam my life. That is the type of dedication it takes. 10+ HOURS OF STUDYING PER DAY (if you are a genius that can do it in less, that's great lol I am a super average student and I found I had to put in this effort daily). 

Stop comparing yourself to others, if it take your 3 days to cover hypertension and your friend understood it in 1/2 a day, that doesn't mean something is wrong with you. Everyone studies differently. Some topics I was weak on I spent a few days on example: stroke, etc. I am a very, very, very, average student. 

I got through with hard work and prayers. 

Don't try to look for shortcuts - there aren't any.

Now I am doing MCQ prep and I realize, the stronger foundation you build for Evaluating the better your chances are to pass MCQ because A LOT of material is overlap. 

Whatever I have written in this post, not even one person told me. I begged people for help, people who had PASSED and people were so secretive they did not even want to tell me what COURSES they used. lol. I would cry myself to sleep for months, and stopped asking people for help because everyone I asked gave me vague advice, that was not specific. 

If this post can even help 1 person I would be super happy because I would never want what I went through for someone else to go through that same pain. I was alone, I had no friends, actually during my second attempt of EVAL I was not even part of any fb groups etc because I was too ashamed of my failure and being part of such groups gave me anxiety when I would see people talk about topics that I had not studied.

What do i have to include in my quarantine plan?
I am currently planning on going back to my apartment. It is a 3 bedroom and the other rooms will be filled. I am planning on asking my roommates to quarantine or vacate if possible, but my housing situation would be a red flag i believe. I will take an uber back there. 

I am pretty stressed about the possibility of not being allowed back in. Is there anything i should know beforehand so I could prepare better? Thank you.",0.0
166,"Hi Everyone,

So this is my first time using REDDIT, please bear with me. I thought I'd get the advice from honest people.

I currently feel that my entire resume is a mess because I have never really had any real job experience. I dont know how to proceed, after spending around 100K on my MBA, not hearing back from any jobs, its honestly the most depressing thing ever.

Background on me.

Grew up with extremely controlling immigrant parents. I had no choice in what I did or where my career path would go so I kind of went with the flow.

My parents forced me into a science program at a top Canadian university. As most science degrees go, you likely need to pursue further education because you dont really use your degree. I hated this program and I hated the degree but graduated with a 3.9. After graduation, couldn't find any employment and didn't know what I wanted to do so I took an offer at an insurance company doing administrative work. I later moved on to another insurance company reviewing health claims. I also hated this role but had a lot of financial responsibilities put on me from my family and stayed there for years. Prior to leaving my MBA I was making around 75k. I decided to pursue my MBA after searching online because  I really wanted to go into marketing, specifically brand management at a clothing retailer or tech company. My MBA school is considered a top school in Canada but its not recognized anywhere else.

Throughout the MBA program, I obtained pretty good grades. But still could never secure employment or an internship. I went into a state of depression in the summer when I couldn't secure an internship. I have used the resources at my school from advisors to professionals who help you build your resume. My school has a heavy international student population, and a large network of alumni. However, none are very open to helping you. Doesn't seem alumni are emotionally connected to the school and after 100s and 100s of coffee chats in the past two years I have given up a bit. As a domestic student at my school, I often felt lost and unsupported.

I ultimately feel that I wasted 5 years in a dead end job that does not offer any value to me as an MBA graduate. How should I even proceed given my circumstances, Covid-19, and all other factors? Any tips are welcome? I have tried applying to various marketing roles (not trying to be picky), but I never seem qualified. I also wonder should I be looking into roles that pay much less than the job I left prior to starting school.

All advice welcome, thank you.",0.0

Little bit of a rant/stream of consciousness....

I'm a soon to be 27 M trying to make moves in my life. To put it into context, I was a very talented dancer but struggled with a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, along with some childhood trauma. I come from a mixed race lower middle class family that was always on the fence about letting me pursue dance. My father didn't see it as a wise career choice for a male, and my mom was tired of covering the bills and tuition for so many years after my dad left us.

Fast forward to high school graduation, I had no idea what to do. I'm from Canada so taking a year off after high school is common. I ended up taking two years off of high school continuing my dance training in hopes to prepare myself to audition for prestigious schools in the US. One summer I attended a dance convention in NYC that was giving out college scholarships to selective participants. Even though I wasn't a part of the competition aspect of the convention, I attended the college scholarship audition and walked away with 3 scholarships and additional money from the convention.

I end up at a great liberal arts school in NYC to major in dance at 19. Those 4 years at school were some of the best and worst years of my life. I struggled extremely hard with anxiety, depression, financial hardships, bulimia and so much more. I could barely stay awake and focus on my academic classes after I woke up extra early to get to the gym and also pushed myself too hard in my technique classes that were scheduled before academics in the afternoon and evening. I can't believe I'm writing this about myself, but I was one of the top dancers in my class. I was always praised for my technique but encouraged to bring out my personality in my dancing. Little did my professors know that I was hurting so deeply inside, which made it so difficult to even know who I was and how to express that in my dancing. I managed to pull myself through the 4 years with terrible coping mechanisms such as alcohol abuse, starvation, and having to use my physical body to pay my bills. My parents didn't know how expensive it was to live here and we've always just done the bare minimum to get by. Being around my rich friends, I couldn't dare open up to them about all of my struggles and how I was dealing with them.

Anyway, I ended up graduating, which I am still surprised I made it there. I left school with no prospective dance jobs, as many do in this industry, but mostly because I had no idea how to network and put myself out there during college. I was way too focused on making it through. I ended up taking on work at fitness studios around NYC in exchange for free classes- I was still very focused on my body image and now that I wasn't dancing hours a day, I needed some other physical activity. I dedicated myself to receptionist and administrative work that I deeply hated while I watched my friends slowly enter the dance world. I worked extremely hard at these jobs and went above and beyond to prove myself. I thought if I couldn't pursue the dreams I had, then I better be the best at the most simple tasks. I developed some decent relationships and my employers spoke of me highly, but I had absolutely no desire to be sitting at a desk in a fitness studio managing rude clients from uptown NYC. I spent the majority of the year after I graduated finally earning some money, working on my mental health, and navigating through adulthood. Before I knew it, I realized that I had not done enough dance work in order to apply for an artist visa. I was devastated. How could I have gone from the dancer who worked so damn hard, spent years commuting to studios on public transit, begged for my parents and grandmother to put me through private school in NYC, had so much potential just fail like that...

I only had 1 year on my student visa after I graduated and by the time I contacted lawyers to see if it was possible for me to work on an artist visa, I was essentially told that I wasted my time in NYC. I ended up moving back to Toronto in the summer of 2019. I was completely heartbroken, angry, sad, and all of the other depressing feelings. I managed to get a part time receptionist job at a hair salon near my house at a lower hourly wage than I was making in NYC. At that time, I was so deep in my depression. I thought things just kept getting worse and worse for me. By the end of 2019, I couldn't take it so as the avoidant person in me would do, I booked a one way train ticket to Vancouver. I thought this was my time to find myself again. I would move across that country and run away from my problems and start new. I could tap into my inner nature lover alt style self and settle in the PNW. Of course I realized as soon as I got there that I had no idea where I was going to live ( I was able to stay at a friends place for 3 weeks as he was out of town) or where I was going to work. I had no friends other than the one who rented his place to me- we were not very close, but rather just acquaintances from years ago.

I fell into old habits of ""comfortability"" and ended up at the front desk of another fitness studio. Shifts started at 5:45 am and I would wake up at 3:30 so I could leave at 4:30 and walk across the city and think about my life and my failures and how I got to this place. This would continue for weeks. I thought that I could really unpack the choices I made in the past and start to look at them as lessons. I always knew I wanted to go back to school again. I wanted to redeem myself from not putting in more effort into my academics during undergrad since I was so focused on so many other issues. I also knew that if I wanted to live in NYC again, I would have to either apply to school or talk about marriage with my partner who still lived in nyc, and our relationship wasn't in a great place as we were long distance and this was the start of the pandemic. I started to use those early morning walks to think about my passions and values. I thought that I wanted to become a food journalist to shed light on eating disorders, veganism, and wellness in the dance industry. I got a job at the local food co-op that I figured would be an interesting experience that could help me with my application. I put together an application for NYU Food Studies MA and was accepted to my surprise. This was so validating to me. I could have never imagined being accepted to NYU. I had so many doubts about my academic voice, and to make things more interesting, I didn't even formally apply to schools for my undergrad, I was just accepted based on my dancing at the summer audition.

I was on cloud 9 for a while until I realized that there was no way my family could afford to pay for that school. As the pandemic became more and more serious, I realized I would feel terrible trying to reconnect with my absent father who I only speak with 3-5 times a year to ask him to cosign a line of credit for me as so many of us were losing jobs. At this moment I realized food journalism wasn't my passion. I didn't want to risk trying to get private loans in the US or moving to another country in this time of uncertainty in addition to bizarre policies being put in place by Trump, which ended up affecting many international students in the US. I deferred my admission with hopes in the back of my mind that covid would ease up by 2021 and I would have time to apply for scholarships and such. Neither of those happened, and by June of 2021, I was exhausted. I found myself in a similar place that I was when I was working in NYC— I was going way above and beyond at the food co-op to prove that I was capable of doing things. I craved validation so much. This cycle was toxic for me. I would start jobs, put forth so much effort to prove myself, begin to feel extreme anxiety if I made one mistake, start to think negatively about myself and the job position, and then quit. I told myself that I would move home to Toronto after only 6 or so months in Vancouver to be closer to family during the pandemic when the reality was that I could handle things in my life.

I found a tiny basement apartment in Toronto that I paid for with unemployment because the family home that I grew up in was too small to accommodate me. I spent my days dreaming about moving back to NYC and distracting myself with online fitness classes and such. I came to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I contacted my doctor and they started me on antidepressants. Some of my general anxiety and depression eased, but I was still so frustrated with my life/career journey and wanted to do something about it. For the rest of 2020 and 2021 until this point I have lived in NYC with my partner. We are making things ""work"" for now as we find comfort in each other during the pandemic. We spend our days hanging out with our roommates dog and just exploring nyc like we used to. This time is different though because I am staying at his apartment rent free and he is supporting me with many things such as groceries or dinner and drinks. It's like I'm almost at the place where I want to be, yet so far. I want to have my own place and return back to NYC on my own terms, not relying on someone else, which ends up with deep feelings of guilt.

I've been spending countless hours browsing grad programs, writing in grad admissions forums to see if anyone knows an affordable program for someone with a BFA interested in dance, fashion, culture, and community. I could not find anything that would suit me. There are so many programs in NYC, but it felt like none of them connected to me and that I would end up going into even more debt for something that I am not committed to just so that I could move back. I finally came across a program at Pratt the other that is extremely interesting to me. I found out that they are still accepting applications on their website so I emailed them to confirm. I was scheduled for an informal interview, which happened yesterday that I feel like I bombed due to my social anxiety, and poor vocabulary. The man was really nice and to be honest, I don't think that he judged me that hard. I think my inner saboteur/imposter syndrome can easily take over. For some reason I feel good about this program. I feel like it is the first and only grad program that is right for me. I feel like despite all of the hardships and struggles I am currently facing, I am in such a better place than I was last year, or even a couple of months ago. I guess I'm scared to believe that there is a chance that I will get accepted, and even if I do, I am terrified that I won't receive enough funding to make it happen, but something deep inside is telling me this is the right path for me. It's hard to describe and perhaps I'm just a little out of touch with reality, but it's almost like I can see this happening for me. For anyone that has made it to this point, thank you for making it through these messy thoughts and feelings. I just really needed to get this off of my chest. I don't think I am looking for answers or anything, but I hope someone out there can relate!

**TL;DR I am a 27 year old washed up dancer from Canada who once was on the right path but fell off track. I've faced some hardships and obstacles that have set me back, but I recognize the lessons that made me who I am today. I am ready and eager for my comeback moment and hope to move back to NYC soon.**",0.0

169,"\[30,  M, Canada\] - I'm an international student finishing up my PhD soon in  Waterloo, Ontario. Since COVID, I have been very stressed and now that  I'm getting closer to my PhD defense, stress level is off the charts! :)  Making things worse is that I tend to be very private in real life, and  don't like to open up to friends or family about emotional issues, not  that I could now with the COVID isolation.

I  have never had a pen pal before, and like I said, I'm a fairly closed  book in person. But I want to have a person to share and process things  with, and also be there for you and hear from you. I want this to be a  long term penpalship (if this is a word) that continues after COVID is  behind us and life is less stressful.

Topics:

I'm  open to talking about anything. My research is related to artificial  intelligence, and we could talk about that, but I'm not particularly  looking for academic correspondence. We can talk about the small things,  things that stood out in our days, made us happy for a bit, or weighed  on us. We can have philosophical discussions and discuss world events.  We can talk about cultural trends.

I have been trying to get back into reading, we can talk about books, exchange recommendations.

I'd  like to learn a 3rd language one day (English isn't my native  language). I've started learning Mandarin Chinese, but it's so hard! We  can talk about languages.

We can  talk about anything! I'm sure that in the beginning, neither of us will  be comfortable to spill the beans, as it were, about everything in our  lives. But I'm hoping that we grow to trust each other. The point is to  be supportive of each other, not judgemental or critical. 😊

Channel:

I  have always wanted to send and receive hand-written letters. I remember  my older brothers, pre-internet, used to send home letters when they  were away in college. The content of the letters wasn't particularly  beautiful but the process definitely was! I wish we could do physical  mail at some point. But, as a start, I hope we can keep it anonymous (no  addresses, no identifying info). So,  maybe email?

If we build trust  over time and show commitment to the penpalship, and we both feel  comfortable, we can explore physical mail one day!

About you:

I'm  happy to talk to all people all over the world, but I feel we'll have a  better chance of syncing if we're in similar circumstances (eg.,  similar age range, in grad school).

PM if you are interested to discuss more. Thanks! 🤓",1.0
170,"Hi guys, 

I am international student who got accepted to UVic just recently. For 3 years I was studying in Seattle, WA and now its time to move further. The problem is that I am completely new to Canada... like at all. Victoria is the first city I started exploring. I have many difficulties to understand:

1) How to find apt/condos, which websites to use? 

2) What is appropriate/ average cost of rentals, ( my budget is max $600 USD)?

3)  Which areas I should avoid in Victoria (I am female, height 1.5 meter, pretty small)?

4) Where will be pretty safe to locate (I have a car)?

I would be happy to connect with people who are from **TURKMENISTAN  and TURKEY** ( due to politics and government in my country Turkmenistan, I experience hardships and want to connect with people who experience the same things and get tips and advice from them ). Plus people who speak **Russian** would be really helpful. 

Thank you for every person who will contribute to this post, indeed it is very stressful moving to a new country where you have nobody to guide you. It took me 3 years to adjust in US, I do not want to make the same mistakes  and go through those hardships again. Thank you!

171,"Just making this post cos before I went I did not know how this would work for international students and I could find no info.

Basically, I have a health condition that was added to the list last weds so I knew I was allowed on that front and the federal government has said everyone in Canada is eligible/McGill said internationals could go when called so I figured it was my turn.

I made an appt on Clique Santé and checked the box that said I have no RAMQ card. I went to the Olympic Stadium as this had the most spots free.

I took with me:

Print out of the federal gvmt website saying everyone in Canada was eligible   
Passport  
CAQ  
Study permit  
Driver's license  
(Basically, I was ready for a fight over whether internationals could be vaccinated, it did not happen)

In reality, they only wanted proof that I was part of a vulnerable group (which in fact, is the one thing I did not have because in the press conference last Wednesday, M. Dube said you did not need this). After much stress and arguing, I was admitted when a manager came and called someone higher up. As I was eligible according to the rules for the priority group and did not need proof, I was allowed through. 

Once this was done, they just wanted photo ID (so passport or driver's license would have been ok) and I was done within about 10 mins (plus 15 mins waiting time afterwards for anaphylaxis prevention. They did ask for RAMQ at every step though so be prepared to explain you are an international student many times. 

Moral of the story; McGill is right, internationals are all eligible when their time is called and will not be stopped. The system has not yet got the memo about certain conditions being eligible and not needing proof so if you are going as part of one of these groups, take some evidence (or just argue, you are within your rights). My guess is most students will not have this and so it will just be proof of age they require, which is on your ID anyway.

The only issue some people might have is that half the staff did not speak English. I can speak French and there were bilingual people so I am sure they could get one to compensate if you really need it but I guess you might have to wait for one to be free? I cannot really comment on that as I just switched to French.

That is all the info I can think of. Very happy to have had a shot and super grateful to be in a country where this is possible :)",0.0
172,"Kind of a loose rant up ahead, also grammer and spelling is terrible, cause I suck at writing (trying to get better at it).

I'm not an international student or anything. I've lived in Ontario for most of my life, specifically in the GTA ever since I was a kid. 

As a kid, the most talked-about thing was ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"", and you'd usually get a variety of answers depending on what that kid valued the most at the time. Most being money-oriented, some with big dreams and goals, and others just want to be respected. I've always have been one of the big dreams and goals kid. I didn't know what I wanted to do or where I wanted to do it. But, hell if I was going to do something. I would be the best at it. I know that it's a naive mentality, and that ""the world doesn't work that way."". But, I was a kid. I believed it to be true, and kind of held onto it for basically the rest of my life, cause I'm only 18, and I'm a sucker for pure optimism.

High school comes around, and this is where everybody talks about which university they want to go to. Everybody jumping on the UofT bandwagon, and trying to make there parents proud by going to the best university in Canada. I didn't really need UofT, I believed that all the universities would still have the same thing. 

The whole vibe of university, where you make life-long friends. Go up against professors and pushing everything to the deadline. Late night study sessions. Going out for a coffee. That's something I wanted. I wanted to be intellectually challenged as much as I could take with my peers, the people I would talk to for the rest of my life. That's what I believed university to be, that's what I wanted. A real intellectual challenge. 

High school was never really that for me. I wasn't a straight-A student. But, I could pass without barely trying. 

I choose to go to York University by the time of April (I think). I thought that it was kind of close and I could save money by commuting instead of getting a dorm. But, either way I was EXCITIED! All this build-up by friends and peers, parents and siblings. This was my moment, my moment to shine. I wanted to show the world what I was made of. What I could do if I really tried. 

The day comes around, I get off the 501A. Come towards this huge university. Where I would be spending 4 years, and nothing happens. It never lived up to the expectation in my mind. I found the nearest coffee shop grabbed a cup and just sat there. I don't mean to undermine depression or anything, and I wasn't diagnosed. But I think I was. 

Depressed. For the next few months I would attend classes and just hate every second of it. I hated it. I hated everything to do with York. It's the most lonely I have ever been. I don't say a word to anyone for most of the days I'm there. Except the few calls from my parents just wondering where I was. Every place I was there were people. But, even among a crowd you can still feel like the only person there. 

To explain it a bit more. It's like dreaming as a kid of going to disneyland. But, when you get there, it's just this one broken down shitty ride, that goes around in a circle. Now, you have to ride that circle for the next 4 years. 

The only thing I really had was this journal. I still have it, and I still write in it. While I'm at York. It's really kept me sane for that amount of time. No matter how many different kinds of strange looks I got. I didn't really care, it saved me. Writing down that I was confused, and the future is confusing. For all I know that this was going to be my life. Was strangely therapeutic. It eased my mind, no matter how many tears I put into it. 

And now I'm here. I think I'm doing better, and probably that maybe I was being a tad too dramatic. I've talked to my \*other\* university friends. They kind of had the same experience. So regardless of UTM or Ryerson. I think it still would've come down to this.

I don't know why I wrote this. Not for a call of help, maybe to resonate with any other Yorkians (I think it sounds better than Lions). Hopefully, some young lad might read this and think more about what university is. 

I might even change my mind. Who knows? It is only my first year (18M). And regardless of how shitty this first year was (Coronavirus and all). Things might get better.

Okay so international student doing co-op here. I already have my coop work permit.

My first co-op term was/is this May-August.

However, I did not manage to land a position through my university co-op job board.

By the start of May, I gave up on getting a coop position and decided to go Hail Mary and just apply for jobs outside of any expectation of coop or whatever.

As it so happened, I managed to land a great job which happens to satisfy my coop requirements (this job was NOT listed as a coop job, just a regular tech/IT job - no mention of coop whatsoever in it).

So once it’s approved for coop and all, I didn’t really see the point of coop anymore since I planned to stick to it. Additionally, I’m having health issues so I sent a notice of withdrawal from the co-op program.

But my advisor is saying that withdrawing from it like this may have implications on my future PGWP application.

I don’t understand how or why this would be the case.

I never used my coop permit to get this job (just using my normal study permit). Even after getting it approved, my manager said that my job is still based on the study permit and no co-op basis.

Further, I am allowed to work full time in summer (I was a full time student during Winter 2020-2021 and will be a full time student in Fall 2021).

I have, to my knowledge, not violated any laws whatsoever. Is this still some kind of violation?

This is stressing me out. Does this have any implication on my PGWP?

Alright so, Ill try my best to keep this succint, but theres a lot of ground to cover. I post here on Relationship Advice a lot, usually as the advice giver, but this time Im coming here looking for feedback.

This is a really long one. I really apologize but its extremely hard to take an entire year of stuff and boil it down.... A lot of this info is very contextually important.

Yes. This is all true, I could post screen caps of the convos/fights etc if really needed, but I wont for now out of respect for my (ex?) friend.

# Backstory, Childhood Friends

To begin, this Best Friend is actually my internet ex-GF, but from way *way* back, like we had a LDR online relationship when we were 13, met on an online game. Im from Canada, shes from The States. But we became ""BF"" and ""GF"" for about a year and a half, and though we did grow apart and broke up, we stayed fast friends and chatted many times a week, sometimes staying up past midnight, talking away about our days. This went on for another solid year and a bit well after we broke up and got new SOs, and we even would go to each other for relationship advice and whatnot at this point.

However, she did some international student stuff in High School and literally went off to the other side of the world. Like literally the other side. So, we drifted apart. She lived her life, I lived mine, we would check in every now and then but less and less often.

I got myself a lovely GF, whom I just had my 10th anniversary with in December. I consider her my best friend, or one of, and we are a solid couple. We love each other deeply, and there isn't any kind of ""but"" here as you often see. She really is a great person, she's gone through a lot of therapy to deal with some past stuff and I really admire what a strong and compassionate person my GF is.

# Reconnecting

A bit more than a year ago I realised I hadn't spoken to my childhood friend in like, 9 years now or so, so I reached out to her. Surprisingly, she instantly reciprocated the interest in reconnecting and it was like we hadnt even missed a beat. We quickly caught up on our lives with each other and were right back to talking every day.

Before you ask, yes my GF was completely aware of all this and didnt have an issue with it. In fact, she also proceeded to connect with my ex-GF, and the two of them actually quickly became friends as well. They even mailed each other I guess, and for my ex's B-day we bought her a kind of ""Canadian care package"" and mailed it to her, and she opened our gift over video chat.

Soon enough we were occasionally video chatting together, sharing memes, had a group chat, etc. She was actually going on a huge 3 month europe trip and basically the entire trip she would check in daily with us, showing and telling us about all the amazing experiences she had, asking us for thoughts on what to do next, where to go next, etc etc.

Over the course of about 8 months, the three of us had become best friends, and it was really cool!

# Polyamory

Now, my GF and I are poly, and this was well known very early on, and she actually had kind of expressed she had thought of the concept as well, and was cool with it. About 9 months in I had come to terms with the fact I still had feelings for this woman, which I wasn't terribly surprised about. I was transparent about this with her, but also was clear that it wasnt a big deal and I didnt have expectations, and that I wasn't asking her to be my GF or anything, just being open about how I felt. I made it clear this didnt need to put her in a ""weird spot"" or anything, and I wasnt going to be the jealous type. But I also didnt want to lie to her about how I felt.

This at the time didnt seem to be an issue, and it became clear I was cool with things when she admitted she had a bit of a fling with a guy she met during the trip, and I was cool with that and encouraged her to have fun with it, including a ""Why are you talking to me right now? You're literally on a date with him!"" moment, where I encouraged her to go get some, and I really meant that for the record. I was happy to see her happy. And I think in our convos this showed, as she opened up more about things after.

# Planning the Canada trip

Post europe trip, we started talking about her coming up here to Canada for a visit. Obviously since she just got back from a Europe trip, she needed some time to kind of settle back, pay off debts, etc.

I ended up noting that Christmas break would work best for me, since I could get a whopping 12 days straight off of work at a cost of only 3 vacation days, and she ended up going for that period. So she was set to visit right after Christmas and be here for New Years.

# Withdrawal 

Now, this is kind of where I noticed things got... weird with her. She kind of withdrew a lot, and I think a large part of this was post trip depression. She often mentioned being in a funk, feeling down, and would disappear for days on end. Note that this was like a heavy shift from ""Messaging every day, multiple times a day"" to ""I havent heard from her in like, 6 days now, I hope she is okay?""

She never talked a lot about this period even afterwards, just referring to it as a ""mental backslide"". We ended up having a fight during this period that boiled down to a miscommunication, where she misunderstood something I had texted. Only after reviewing afterwards did she then start profusely apologizing about how the entire fight was built on her misreading something I wrote.

# The Canada Trip

Nonetheless, as the trip drew nearer she seemed to brighten up again and in the couple leading weeks, it became a lot of ""Oh my god I cant believe we are doing this after 14 years!"" (We had always talked about meeting IRL as kids many many years ago)

We planned tonnes of outings, and when she arrived... It actually went amazing. Like really really amazing. Honestly speaking, best week of my life, straight up.

We went on a bunch of dates (all three of us together), she stayed at our place and slept on our couch and settled in nearly instantly, within a couple days she was already at home. We all clicked asap and it was like we had known each other our whole lives. I mean we kind of did but... theres a certain difference between texting over the internet and actually talking face to face.

We tripped on acid together, we held hands at a concert we went to, and on New years... She kissed us! It was kind of spontaneous and unexpected and happened while tripping acid, but she grabbed me and kissed me, then grabbed my GF and kissed her. Lots of laughing and whatnot.

Though my GF was a bit taken aback by this (She wasnt *super* into it but not not into it, also, we were on acid), it all seemed cool and fine for the rest of the night.

# The first red flag

Heres where the first ""Wtf"" moment happened though, and I think now I have a bead on it, but it was the first big red flag moment that I still ponder to date.

At the end of the night, both of us still on acid, I was sitting on the end of the couch gathering up the courage to talk to her about something she had said awhile back that had been bothering me. However, she caught me off guard by suddenly stating ""Im picking up on the vibe you would like a good night kiss?"" with a bit of a sly smile. That obviously was not what I was going for but I mean... I was down!

So I responded with a bit of floundering for a moment, very much caught off guard by the emotional whiplash, before stammering up a ""Do *you* want to kiss?"" Because truly speaking, her question wasn't actually consenting to a kiss. You could very much interpret it as asking for a kiss as much as you could interpret it as ""YOu are making me uncomfortable right now""

However, she responded to this with a wider sly smile and kind of a sarcastic ""C'mon, really?"" and opened her arms up, followed by a ""Come here you"" and pulled me in for our second kiss that night. It was a good kiss, I distinctly remember her hand  on the back of my neck too. This wasn't some faint awkward kiss, it was a pretty serious one. This is all important for what follows.

So after the kiss I got up, wished her a good night, and went to bed. There was a bit of awkward laughing after of course but then I went to bed basically floating in happiness. My GF was a bit peeved we kissed with her out of the room, and we had a text convo about how there was to be no more kissing without consent all around, which I agreed to and apologized for, and we kind of worked that out. I agreed the next morning I'd tell my ex that kissing can't happen behind closed doors, and I expected she'd be very understanding.

The next morning though when we woke up, my ex seemed... really off. Very curt and short with me. Kind of avoiding talking a bit. She then asked if we could go out and grab coffees. I kind of at this point chalked it up to us being acid hung over, and agreed.

As soon as we stepped outside though, she opened with ""Do you think I am stupid?"". Not sure where this was going, I responded that of course not, I didn't. She then started expressing feelings of resentment, betrayal, and frustration. Stating that I had ignored boundaries the previous night, ""put the moves on her"", and effectively spun a narrative that by me sitting on the end of the couch, she had felt compelled to kiss me.

Now all of this was totally blindsiding me. That wasn't remotely how I remembered any of it, and I then confirmed with my GF (who though was in the other room, the door was open and she heard everything. Also, my GF was sober, only my ex and I dropped acid that night, so she confirmed everything I remembered was accurate).

I absolutely remember her smiling about it, I remember after the kiss she smiled and thanked me for a wonderful night. I remember her hand on the back of my neck, holding me in the kiss for an extra second or two. I remember the pressure as she came up to meet me, expecting it to be a peck on the cheek and then feeling her lips on mine, being startled, then happy, and it going on for a solid few seconds.

These are memories I am 100% confident in. And after a bit she did kind of admit I had left her in the darkness, still on acid, alone with her thoughts for several hours. There were numerous other facts I was able to point out that made it very obvious that any form of trying to circumvent enthusiastic consent made no sense for me. I mean part of it was literally a convo we had like 15 minutes prior to the kiss about how she hated how a different friend of hers always tried to drag the acid trips out and never knew when to call it quits, and when wishing her good night I literally said ""I dont want to do that to you, I think it might be a good time to call it a night""

I then told her about how I was gathering up courage to talk about &lt;thing she said months ago that had been bothering me&gt; and that was part of how I was 100% confident I wasn't trying to fish for a kiss. This kind of instantly made things click for her I guess, because she started backpedaling hard and apologizing and admitting that ""acid brain can really fuck with your perception"" and stuff.

Nonetheless, I was really wary the rest of that trip. I was careful about boundaries a lot more and we didn't kiss or anything for the rest of the trip. Things did seem to get more romantic though. The last day we cooked together, went to a cat cafe and basically walked around town for a solid 2 hours, just chatting and connecting.

# The rest of the trip went well though!

At the end of the trip, while on the cab drive to the airport, she was gushing about how now I had to visit her home town, and all the things she would show me, how we could go on a road trip together, meet her friends, etc. On that last night when I offered the option for her to join us and cuddle up in bed, she even stated that she really did genuinely like the sound of it, but would decline.

We had convos at the airport and we agreed as nice as it wouldve been to cuddle up together, it was nice to also leave new fun things for the next trip, and she seemed enthusiastic about that. I made it clear I still had feelings for her, we hugged at the airport, and she then held the hug and looked up at me and told me how she was incredibly glad she chose to do this, and had no regrets, before leaving.

# Second withdrawal

And then just like that, things seemed to rapidly go to shit.

She got back home, and we chatted a bit, but it very very quickly became apart she was really rapidly growing distant. Once again we abruptly shifted over to ""I havent heard from her in like several days now, I hope she's doing okay?"", and once again noting this was a shift from chatting every single day.

After a bit I mentioned about how I was indeed interested in visiting her next, and had various dates it could work in a couple months down the road. Im moderately well off and do well for myself, and trips to her specific state are honestly dirt cheap.

This was before the whole COVID-19 thing became a big deal here, I did not know at this time that the very dates we were discussing wouldve been right when the lockdown would've begun and the flights wouldve been totally cancelled.

She seemed super enthused about a road trip idea, showing me her state, going to destinations, doing a haunted hotel and sharing a room, etc etc.

I then brought up and effectively asked her if she was still feeling comfortable about going out on these dates with me, what with my feelings for her. This was based on the context of that acid night, basically I had taken note of the fact that though in the moment she seemed enthusiastic, later it seemed she actually wasn't as enthusiastic and was just ""playing along"" so as not to ""rock the boat"", so to say. So. I was checking in on this.

She responded with ""I dont know"".

When I asked if she wanted to talk about it, she said she wasnt comfortable talking about it right now.

She never did end up wanting to talk about it, though I brought it up a couple more times.

Things grew a LOT more distant. At one point my GF and I mentioned maybe doing like a video chat date thing for valentines, how she would feel about that? She responded with ""I dont know but reading that kind of made me start crying?""

When we asked about this she just once again had a lot of ""I dont know""s for us. Didnt even go into detail over if it was like... stress? anxiety? or happy? crying...

It got really frustrating at this point where I would open up about something, try to talk about it, or she would ask me a question... then suddenly dip out and go AFK after I wrote out my response. **For upwards to 24 hours after**

When I asked about this she'd just say she ""Didnt know how to respond"" or that ""Facebook is being glitchy""

# Ghosting starts

My ghosting senses were tingling. I was perceiving that she was not into the romantic tones of our convos, but when I would check in and offer that it was okay,  there wasn't any pressure, and that I was fine with us just being friends, she still just had a bunch of ""I dont knows"" and talked about feeling conflicted. Not about what though, everything was super vague.

So coming up to within a week of the day we were supposed to start making plans for my visit down to her state (We picked a date that we would video chat and just discuss options, what we were feeling, do a check in on what we wanted, etc), and she got *really* distant. Rarely responding, really checked out of the whole biz.

At a point I sent her a message remarking that her dipping out mid-convo was frustrating, and that I ""Really want to be your friend, but you are making it really hard""

She talked about how she probably was secluding and isolating from everyone (not just us, all her other friends too) as some act of protection, to avoid being hurt.

# Falling out

In the end, on the very day we were supposed to chat about my trip, she opened up and said that messages from me had been making her feel intense anxiety lately. This hurt like... a lot to read.

Leading up to this I had made the call with my GF that maybe it was time to end things, to note. The constant hot and cold, the red flags, and what seemed to be a kind of lack of respect for the energy we were putting in... it seemed like a lot of energy we were putting in and she wasn't giving much back, and instead was just further pulling away.

So reading that, I definitely didnt love hearing that by messaging her I was hurting her... so I broke things off and told her that it seemed best for us to end things. I expressed how her behavior had been hurting me and that I perceived a lack of enthusiasm around our friendship.

Now along with that message she sent, mentioned above, she also stated that she didnt want to be my GF, and that the prospect made her uncomfortable... I never had asked her to be my GF, and I had made it clear several times over that wasn't what I was asking of her. Like... a lot. I had no idea and still have no idea why she was making it out like I was trying to ask her to go steady with me. I would never ask someone I had literally only spent a week with in person to be my GF, thats ridiculous.

Nonetheless, she perceived me cutting things off there as in response to the ""I dont want to be your GF"" remark... not the ""Messages from you are giving me anxiety"" remark.

She tore into me, calling me a Nice Guy TM (this one stung because I would often share posts from here on Relationship Advice about Nice guys, calling them out for their behavior, with her, so she knew calling me that would sting hard), saying I was shitty like every other guy, bunch of stuff.

She told me to block her then, so I did.

I ended up regretting that later that day, unblocked her, told her that I was cutting things off for reasons stated above and I didnt care, and had never cared, about the fact she wasnt wanting to be my GF, and that I had already been very fully aware of this.

She responded by blocking me, then unblocking me a bit later, remarking she hated blocking people.

# Trying to fix things

A bit later I wrote up a several page letter. I concluded I had 3 things to apologize for.

1. I had focused too much on the romantics and that put pressure on her to perform, and I shouldve been clearer that I still valued our friendship far more than any romantics.

2. I should've picked up on her lack of enthusiasm sooner.

3. I did not speak out about how her actions were making me resentful sooner. If I had just spoken up about it asap, it wouldn't have caused the feelings to build up over time.

I also in this letter however detailed the actions she had done that caused me to feel rejected, however I very much took ownership for my actions, this is verbatim a paragraph from the letter:

&gt; But now here is where I take responsibility. Because I can’t put much, if any, of the blame on you. See the thing is, I was so wrapped up after your trip in the romance, the possibility of it being maybe a thing, and how much I so badly wanted to make it work, that I let all of these little rejections kind of slide by. I put so much energy into convincing myself that it didn’t matter, it was fine, it didn’t hurt. 

However, this I guess just made her more angry. She stated that my letter wasnt a real apology and that I just blamed her for everything. I very much took ownership of my actions in that letter though, I double checked it with a few people and they all stated I did indeed apologize as far as they saw. I had that shit spell checked and everything by two people in my companies writing department, and they gave me solid feedback.

We like, briefly made up for like an hour, then I mentioned the fact that I kind of felt a bit hurt by her stating all I cared about from her was romantics, and didnt care about her friendship. Because she seemed to be forgetting the fact that when we were kids (yeah, see now its relevant info), she broke up with me and yet we stayed close friends for over a year after... if I only cared about her for romantics... then why did I stay such close friends with her even after we both had moved on? It felt like when she accused me of being a Nice Guy TM who only cares about her body she had thrown out that entire year of our childhood friendship.

This seemed to *really* piss her, saying she had no idea what I was playing at, what my game was, that I must be remembering things different (I asked what she meant by that and never got an answer), and this kind of just set her off all over again, saying I was so angry (I literally stated ""It makes me feel sad when you x because of y"" in my text, so I dont know how she got ""anger"" out of that...), etc etc.

# The Fallout

Then went ""I cant do this anymore"" and... blocked me. For real this time.

Now I have our texts and chats from when we were 13, we used Gmail for it, so that shit is all still saved in my inbox. I flipped through it, both for old times sake, but also in a ""What on earth was she talking about"" look to maybe grasp what she meant by me ""Not remembering it the same""... but nope, I didnt see anything. Just lots of convos of us staying up past midnight talking about relationships and life and wishing we could see each other at least once and show each other our home towns.

My GF at one point sent her a message on Facebook, she never responded. As far as I know nothing ever ended up going down between my ex and my gf, they just stopped talking after the fight between my ex and I.

# The Book

Now heres the weird part though, that Im still having trouble understanding. And heres where now I need advice. I really hope you read all the shit above, cause all that context is important here, because it gives you a bead on her personality.

When she went back home, I lent her a very very important book of mine. I informed her it was super important and held a lot of meaning to me, but shes someone I could trust with it. She told me she would take the utmost of care of the book.

She still has it.

I poked her on LinkedIn (we were connected on there and she didnt block me) and simply just told her ""Not trying to ask forgiveness or whatever... I just wanted to remind you you still have my book and I still want it back once you are done with it. Please let me know when you will get it back to me"" etc etc.

She responded with a thumbs up.

Weeks rolled by, she never told me anything. I poked again, Where was my book? No response. I poked again, kind of every week or two ""Hey... its been a few weeks and still no word on my book. I dont want this to be awkard but you arent even responding about like, when you expect to be done with it""

Eventually I gave up and stated that I was going to assume the worst and that I wouldn't be getting it back after a whole month of being ignored, and finally she then responded back that ""Yeah shed get it back to me eventually, its just not a priority for her""

This is so confusing. If she wanted to be done with the relationship and finally close everything up and truly end things, I imagine she would've sent that book back asap so I would no longer have a reason to message her, right?

So I then stated I was feeling hurt about this, because it felt like by holding onto the book while also not giving me any kind of deadline, like ""Ill give you an update by the end of the month"" or something, she was stringing me along and forcing me to keep this mental tab open all the time. And that really sucked. It felt manipulative, or, I dunno, something? Like its just so confusing.

This pissed her off and she told me she just hadnt gotten around to sending it back yet because it just wasnt a priority. She also stated ""I was also waiting for some other stuff to arrive in the mail I was going to send with it, but nevermind now""

Which is like... wtf does that mean? What things? I never asked for anything at all, I still to date have ZERO idea what she's even mentioning about that.... Contextually, my birthday was 3 weeks away then? Maybe it was some kind of ""Well I *was* gonna get you a bday gift but nevermind now""

But who the hell gets a birthday gift for someone they just cut off all contact with and blocked, and furthermore, like shipping that book is gonna be, what, $12 tops? Like just send the book now and then like, send whatever the hell other thing you are talking about later? And she had *never* brought this whole ""other stuff"" up ever prior. There was no mention of it before...

So I sent a few messages after. Mostly just post COVID-19 stuff wishing her well and hoping her family is doing okay, and that after this whole mess I understand that obviously I am not expecting her to be able to send me my book anytime soon.

She has never responded since, still seems to be ignoring me.

I sent her a message the other day on xbox live, asking if she would feel comfortable playing the rare game of overwatch together, she never responded to that either.

# Advice

Im at the end of my rope here folks. I feel like I have two options.

1. Give up and accept this really cool person who I truly had thought was respectable, honorable, dependable, trustworthy, has like... fucked off with my very highly valued book and has totally betrayed my trust. Accepting this is just... it feels awful. Like that shit is a super hard pill to swallow and... its going to be super hard to ever trust someone again for a long time after. Like this has really fucked me up. That book meant a lot to me, *and she knew it*

2. This is my long shot here, kind of my last possible resort and it makes me feel fucked even thinking about it... I think I might maybe need to call her? But she lives with her mom at the moment and theres a 95% chance her mom is going to answer the phone. I also am going to need to message her mom on FB and ask her for her phone number and if she's okay with me calling them. And thats gonna be like a whole thing.

For context we would often phone chat with each other as kids, so there were plenty of instances of me calling, her mom answering, us chatting for 5 seconds, then her handing her phone off to her daughter. So this woman vaguely knows me as ""That canadian my daughter had a thing with"", this lady isnt a complete stranger.

But its still like, awkward as fuck you know?

However this might be my last hail mary to get my book back, and maybe possibly fix things? Like all of our fights always happened over text because text loses all context and emotion. When we chat over video, or when we chatted in person, we connected deeply and everything felt a billion times smoother. Text chat just suuuucks and I feel was a deep root in our fights.

Theres this small chance maybe if I call, I might get through to her, and might be able to talk to her? Maybe? Maybe even fix things? Or at the very least go from ""Never speaking again"" to ""Not speaking but at least we got closure""?

Like I *really* want to know what on earth she meant by some of those last things she said, but never got an explanation on... Its driving me crazy.

Or it like *really* fucks things up 100x worse and shes like ""What the FUCK you CALLED ME?! YOU TALKED TO MY MOM?!?!?""

I am very much torn on this.

This is my last hail mary folks. Should I go for it?

The life of the[international studen](http://studyaucanada.ca/)t is complex and potentially difficult, even under normal circumstances. Consider the steps it takes to apply for and secure a student visa, plus organizing housing and work, building friendships, learning a new language . . . To be sure, taking on an international education is not for the faint-hearted.

However, in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are additional stressors for international students to consider. While some students [**receive work permits** ](http://studyaucanada.ca/2020/07/covid-19-international-students/)to work off-campus, many international students rely solely on their on-campus earnings—including that from research assistantships, teaching assistantships, employment in the Student Union, etc.—to get by. But, what happens when a pandemic shuts down educational institutions of all levels across North America?

**Student working life**

According to the government of Canada, “on-campus work” is defined by its physical presence on campus, and student workers whose work is related to teaching or research can take place off-campus. For students whose work is not related to teaching or research, campus closures might mean the end of their employment. And, unless a student has received an off-campus work permit, the possibility of securing employment elsewhere is unrealistic.

The loss income can compound the stress created by concerns about physical and mental health, worries about loved ones at home, and the emotional toll created by social distancing and isolation.

**Student visa changes**

Another major area of concern for international students is the on-campus classes required to qualify for a [student visa](http://studyaucanada.ca/2020/07/covid-19-international-students/). If classes are diverted online in the fall—as a majority of Canadian institutions have done already—there could be significant implications for international students, especially in relation to applications for post-graduation work permits.

IRCC has released [amended guidelines for international students](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2020/07/minister-mendicino-announces-changes-to-facilitate-online-learning-for-international-students.html). For the fall of 2020, international students who complete online coursework abroad will be able to count this coursework in their application for post-graduate work permits. In addition, IRCC will be offering priority processing for student visas which have been submitted online, in order to provide international students with more flexibility to study in Canada or in their home countries.

180,"Little bit of a rant/stream of consciousness....

I'm a soon to be 27 M trying to make moves in my life. To put it into context, I was a very talented dancer but struggled with a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, along with some childhood trauma. I come from a mixed race lower middle class family that was always on the fence about letting me pursue dance. My father didn't see it as a wise career choice for a male, and my mom was tired of covering the bills and tuition for so many years after my dad left us.

Fast forward to high school graduation, I had no idea what to do. I'm from Canada so taking a year off after high school is common. I ended up taking two years off of high school continuing my dance training in hopes to prepare myself to audition for prestigious schools in the US. One summer I attended a dance convention in NYC that was giving out college scholarships to selective participants. Even though I wasn't a part of the competition aspect of the convention, I attended the college scholarship audition and walked away with 3 scholarships and additional money from the convention.

I end up at a great liberal arts school in NYC to major in dance at 19. Those 4 years at school were some of the best and worst years of my life. I struggled extremely hard with anxiety, depression, financial hardships, bulimia and so much more. I could barely stay awake and focus on my academic classes after I woke up extra early to get to the gym and also pushed myself too hard in my technique classes that were scheduled before academics in the afternoon and evening. I can't believe I'm writing this about myself, but I was one of the top dancers in my class. I was always praised for my technique but encouraged to bring out my personality in my dancing. Little did my professors know that I was hurting so deeply inside, which made it so difficult to even know who I was and how to express that in my dancing. I managed to pull myself through the 4 years with terrible coping mechanisms such as alcohol abuse, starvation, and having to use my physical body to pay my bills. My parents didn't know how expensive it was to live here and we've always just done the bare minimum to get by. Being around my rich friends, I couldn't dare open up to them about all of my struggles and how I was dealing with them.

Anyway, I ended up graduating, which I am still surprised I made it there. I left school with no prospective dance jobs, as many do in this industry, but mostly because I had no idea how to network and put myself out there during college. I was way too focused on making it through. I ended up taking on work at fitness studios around NYC in exchange for free classes- I was still very focused on my body image and now that I wasn't dancing hours a day, I needed some other physical activity. I dedicated myself to receptionist and administrative work that I deeply hated while I watched my friends slowly enter the dance world. I worked extremely hard at these jobs and went above and beyond to prove myself. I thought if I couldn't pursue the dreams I had, then I better be the best at the most simple tasks. I developed some decent relationships and my employers spoke of me highly, but I had absolutely no desire to be sitting at a desk in a fitness studio managing rude clients from uptown NYC. I spent the majority of the year after I graduated finally earning some money, working on my mental health, and navigating through adulthood. Before I knew it, I realized that I had not done enough dance work in order to apply for an artist visa. I was devastated. How could I have gone from the dancer who worked so damn hard, spent years commuting to studios on public transit, begged for my parents and grandmother to put me through private school in NYC, had so much potential just fail like that...

I only had 1 year on my student visa after I graduated and by the time I contacted lawyers to see if it was possible for me to work on an artist visa, I was essentially told that I wasted my time in NYC. I ended up moving back to Toronto in the summer of 2019. I was completely heartbroken, angry, sad, and all of the other depressing feelings. I managed to get a part time receptionist job at a hair salon near my house at a lower hourly wage than I was making in NYC. At that time, I was so deep in my depression. I thought things just kept getting worse and worse for me. By the end of 2019, I couldn't take it so as the avoidant person in me would do, I booked a one way train ticket to Vancouver. I thought this was my time to find myself again. I would move across that country and run away from my problems and start new. I could tap into my inner nature lover alt style self and settle in the PNW. Of course I realized as soon as I got there that I had no idea where I was going to live ( I was able to stay at a friends place for 3 weeks as he was out of town) or where I was going to work. I had no friends other than the one who rented his place to me- we were not very close, but rather just acquaintances from years ago.

I fell into old habits of ""comfortability"" and ended up at the front desk of another fitness studio. Shifts started at 5:45 am and I would wake up at 3:30 so I could leave at 4:30 and walk across the city and think about my life and my failures and how I got to this place. This would continue for weeks. I thought that I could really unpack the choices I made in the past and start to look at them as lessons. I always knew I wanted to go back to school again. I wanted to redeem myself from not putting in more effort into my academics during undergrad since I was so focused on so many other issues. I also knew that if I wanted to live in NYC again, I would have to either apply to school or talk about marriage with my partner who still lived in nyc, and our relationship wasn't in a great place as we were long distance and this was the start of the pandemic. I started to use those early morning walks to think about my passions and values. I thought that I wanted to become a food journalist to shed light on eating disorders, veganism, and wellness in the dance industry. I got a job at the local food co-op that I figured would be an interesting experience that could help me with my application. I put together an application for NYU Food Studies MA and was accepted to my surprise. This was so validating to me. I could have never imagined being accepted to NYU. I had so many doubts about my academic voice, and to make things more interesting, I didn't even formally apply to schools for my undergrad, I was just accepted based on my dancing at the summer audition.

I was on cloud 9 for a while until I realized that there was no way my family could afford to pay for that school. As the pandemic became more and more serious, I realized I would feel terrible trying to reconnect with my absent father who I only speak with 3-5 times a year to ask him to cosign a line of credit for me as so many of us were losing jobs. At this moment I realized food journalism wasn't my passion. I didn't want to risk trying to get private loans in the US or moving to another country in this time of uncertainty in addition to bizarre policies being put in place by Trump, which ended up affecting many international students in the US. I deferred my admission with hopes in the back of my mind that covid would ease up by 2021 and I would have time to apply for scholarships and such. Neither of those happened, and by June of 2021, I was exhausted. I found myself in a similar place that I was when I was working in NYC— I was going way above and beyond at the food co-op to prove that I was capable of doing things. I craved validation so much. This cycle was toxic for me. I would start jobs, put forth so much effort to prove myself, begin to feel extreme anxiety if I made one mistake, start to think negatively about myself and the job position, and then quit. I told myself that I would move home to Toronto after only 6 or so months in Vancouver to be closer to family during the pandemic when the reality was that I could handle things in my life.

I found a tiny basement apartment in Toronto that I paid for with unemployment because the family home that I grew up in was too small to accommodate me. I spent my days dreaming about moving back to NYC and distracting myself with online fitness classes and such. I came to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I contacted my doctor and they started me on antidepressants. Some of my general anxiety and depression eased, but I was still so frustrated with my life/career journey and wanted to do something about it. For the rest of 2020 and 2021 until this point I have lived in NYC with my partner. We are making things ""work"" for now as we find comfort in each other during the pandemic. We spend our days hanging out with our roommates dog and just exploring nyc like we used to. This time is different though because I am staying at his apartment rent free and he is supporting me with many things such as groceries or dinner and drinks. It's like I'm almost at the place where I want to be, yet so far. I want to have my own place and return back to NYC on my own terms, not relying on someone else, which ends up with deep feelings of guilt.

I've been spending countless hours browsing grad programs, writing in grad admissions forums to see if anyone knows an affordable program for someone with a BFA interested in dance, fashion, culture, and community. I could not find anything that would suit me. There are so many programs in NYC, but it felt like none of them connected to me and that I would end up going into even more debt for something that I am not committed to just so that I could move back. I finally came across a program at Pratt the other that is extremely interesting to me. I found out that they are still accepting applications on their website so I emailed them to confirm. I was scheduled for an informal interview, which happened yesterday that I feel like I bombed due to my social anxiety, and poor vocabulary. The man was really nice and to be honest, I don't think that he judged me that hard. I think my inner saboteur/imposter syndrome can easily take over. For some reason I feel good about this program. I feel like it is the first and only grad program that is right for me. I feel like despite all of the hardships and struggles I am currently facing, I am in such a better place than I was last year, or even a couple of months ago. I guess I'm scared to believe that there is a chance that I will get accepted, and even if I do, I am terrified that I won't receive enough funding to make it happen, but something deep inside is telling me this is the right path for me. It's hard to describe and perhaps I'm just a little out of touch with reality, but it's almost like I can see this happening for me. For anyone that has made it to this point, thank you for making it through these messy thoughts and feelings. I just really needed to get this off of my chest. I don't think I am looking for answers or anything, but I hope someone out there can relate!

**TL;DR I am a 27 year old washed up dancer from Canada who once was on the right path but fell off track. I've faced some hardships and obstacles that have set me back, but I recognize the lessons that made me who I am today. I am ready and eager for my comeback moment and hope to move back to NYC soon.**",0.0
181,"Little bit of a rant/stream of consciousness....

I'm a soon to be 27 M trying to make moves in my life. To put it into context, I was a very talented dancer but struggled with a lot of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, along with some childhood trauma. I come from a mixed race lower middle class family that was always on the fence about letting me pursue dance. My father didn't see it as a wise career choice for a male, and my mom was tired of covering the bills and tuition for so many years after my dad left us.

Fast forward to high school graduation, I had no idea what to do. I'm from Canada so taking a year off after high school is common. I ended up taking two years off of high school continuing my dance training in hopes to prepare myself to audition for prestigious schools in the US. One summer I attended a dance convention in NYC that was giving out college scholarships to selective participants. Even though I wasn't a part of the competition aspect of the convention, I attended the college scholarship audition and walked away with 3 scholarships and additional money from the convention.

I end up at a great liberal arts school in NYC to major in dance at 19. Those 4 years at school were some of the best and worst years of my life. I struggled extremely hard with anxiety, depression, financial hardships, bulimia and so much more. I could barely stay awake and focus on my academic classes after I woke up extra early to get to the gym and also pushed myself too hard in my technique classes that were scheduled before academics in the afternoon and evening. I can't believe I'm writing this about myself, but I was one of the top dancers in my class. I was always praised for my technique but encouraged to bring out my personality in my dancing. Little did my professors know that I was hurting so deeply inside, which made it so difficult to even know who I was and how to express that in my dancing. I managed to pull myself through the 4 years with terrible coping mechanisms such as alcohol abuse, starvation, and having to use my physical body to pay my bills. My parents didn't know how expensive it was to live here and we've always just done the bare minimum to get by. Being around my rich friends, I couldn't dare open up to them about all of my struggles and how I was dealing with them.

Anyway, I ended up graduating, which I am still surprised I made it there. I left school with no prospective dance jobs, as many do in this industry, but mostly because I had no idea how to network and put myself out there during college. I was way too focused on making it through. I ended up taking on work at fitness studios around NYC in exchange for free classes- I was still very focused on my body image and now that I wasn't dancing hours a day, I needed some other physical activity. I dedicated myself to receptionist and administrative work that I deeply hated while I watched my friends slowly enter the dance world. I worked extremely hard at these jobs and went above and beyond to prove myself. I thought if I couldn't pursue the dreams I had, then I better be the best at the most simple tasks. I developed some decent relationships and my employers spoke of me highly, but I had absolutely no desire to be sitting at a desk in a fitness studio managing rude clients from uptown NYC. I spent the majority of the year after I graduated finally earning some money, working on my mental health, and navigating through adulthood. Before I knew it, I realized that I had not done enough dance work in order to apply for an artist visa. I was devastated. How could I have gone from the dancer who worked so damn hard, spent years commuting to studios on public transit, begged for my parents and grandmother to put me through private school in NYC, had so much potential just fail like that...

I only had 1 year on my student visa after I graduated and by the time I contacted lawyers to see if it was possible for me to work on an artist visa, I was essentially told that I wasted my time in NYC.

183,"Hi guys,  
This is a very random post where I would be venting how future students at WLU from India are seeking support but Laurier isn't willing to support in the best possible way.   


I'll explain it to you guys from the beginning. I am an Indian Class XII student of CBSE Board. I received a conditional offer letter from WLU for their BBA program on April 5,2021. The conditions were that I obtain mid 80s (considering we don't get to use calculators) in my CBSE Final Exams.   


During the admission process, WLU asked my high school to provide Predicted scores and those were mid 90s. I presented my transcripts which had high 90s as my past scores (I'm not trying to flex or anything, just want to show you guys my exact problem) which clearly proves that I would very easily meet the conditions of offer.  


Now, due to the massive number of Covid-19 cases and critical shortage of oxygen supplies, medicines and just the whole health crisis, the CBSE Board exams (on which my conditions were based on) are postponed indefinitely. It's been 16 months of Class XII(Senior Year) for us Indian students.   


And this is where my problems are further escalated. As per the latest IRCC guidelines, I had to submit my study permit application by May 15 to get a response in time for Fall 21. Failing to do so, they would do their best to answer us back but can't guarantee within the timelines for Fall. Their requirement for Study Permit is a firm Unconditional Offer Letter or a proof that you have met your conditions and I have none of those. I wrote to Laurier International and Choose Laurier but they said they can't issue an unconditional letter for the study permit but they said that they would not rescind my offer incase I don't get my marks by their July 15 deadline.  


Even if they did issue me an unconditional offer taking into consideration my previous scores which were way beyond the conditions, my predicted scores which were again way more than what I am being asked for and the letter of recommendations from my high school teachers, I would still live with this anxiety if I would be able to make it to Canada this fall or if I would have to take a gap year and defer for September 2022 because I am clearly late to apply for Study permit. Universities like UBC, Carleton, Dalhousie, Ottawa, Guelph and many more have all issued Unconditional Offers for their Indian Students but WLU doesn't seem to care. I feel they could have gone an extra mile for international students like myself who would for sure meet the conditions and would be paying almost 3 times the tuition (aprox $30k a year) than a normal domestic student.  


Hoping that at least the Canadian Consulate would understand the special circumstances we Indian students are in right now would give a thumbs up to applications with conditional offers, I have decided to finally decided to file my application by attaching the email from Laurier to file the application with all the other documents I have.  


I thank any and all of you who read this venting post till the last. I really hope you and your family are staying safe and are in good health. I understand that I might get some hate or criticism for expecting an Unconditional offer or some exemptions in the Study Permit rules but please try to imagine yourself in my position with negativity and health crisis all around and the anxiety if you would be able to make it to University this year even when you yourself know that you could have easily met the requirements of your admission.",0.0
184,"Hello everyone !

I request some advice from people knowledgeable here, please...

I'm an incoming MA Econ student for fall 2020. I'm an international student and I'm stuck at home for this fall since online classes are ""non-essential"" and prevent my travel &amp; entry. 

But the immigration department's regulations require at least 50% of the program to be completed from within Canada.  Could you advise me on what UVic officially considers to be the MA Econ program length please? 

I'm confused since the minimum number of tuition instalments is 5 ( which is 20 months ), but then the program is described as a 2-year degree.  What do they count this as officially at UVic?  

I'm having to calculate this only because regulations require at least 50% to be completed within Canada. This issue is causing a lot of anxiety and I'll be grateful for any and all advice please. Thanks a ton!",0.0

So, thing is I was so overwhelmed with the corona thing that for the past weeks I did not continue my job search for the spring. And I know companies would prolly be in a mess at the time too anyways - so I waited for things to calm down. Now, I'm 1 month before next term and I don't know what I should do. 

Background: It was gonna be my 1st co-op. + I'm in Mathematical Physics. And I'm an international student. Also, I got a lease for rent in Waterloo and I know it's hard to sublet this spring in case I have to go to somewhere else. So because of that, I would prolly prefer a job in KW if possible. Otherwise prolly I should go for a study term.

Right now, I'm confused tho. I don't know what I should do. Should I give the job search a try for a week and see. Or do you think I better not mind about that and just go for study term for Spring? 

I'll also need to provide an explanation to my parents (altho they're very understanding and they obviously know what's the situation). So, are the companies still hiring or not? How is the job market doing right now?",0.0

# How I Overcame Imposter Syndrome at UofT

I know many of these posts are either a) very negative or b) very positive. I am going to attempt to give my own, balanced perspective of *my* experience at UofT. 

To start off, I think it's best to give some background. I am from the States attending UofT as an international student who studied economics for a major and statistics/mathematics as a minor. Please keep this in mind as I write the rest of this post (as I may have a very different experience as others at UofT).

Starting off with first-year, first-year was the hardest year for me at University. Coming from good academic standing in high school, I thought UofT would be a breeze. I was terribly wrong. I entered my first year with the idea of going for actuarial science, and in the end, my degree had to change due to poor grades. During this year, I took MAT137, ECO101, ECO102, MAT135, and MAT136. These courses would set a path of imposter syndrome for me for the rest of the year.

For instance, in one of these courses in my first semester, grade deflation was an easy policy for my professors to accept. In my first midterm, my grade was 37.5% and on my second, it was 53%. 

[ 2017 Midterm 1 Grades](https://preview.redd.it/508zlqu99zx61.png?width=2290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=571ebaebda716b74df5a6b29c0ba59dc232c8745)

One thing that shocked me about both these tests was the fact that more than 100 students failed the midterm. This was also consistent with the second midterm. Considering the average was low on both, the professor refused to curve. This led me to LWD and retaking this course in the second semester. This, clearly was the first step in the door of me realizing that this is a school that capitalizes on grade deflation. 

Admittedly, however, first-year was also my best year of university in terms of finding a community. Living at St. Mikes, I was able to meet many people from different countries, backgrounds, and experiences. This not only helped me find a great support network that I can always turn to, but it also fostered a home when mine was several hundred miles away. Though, I have realized as well that many have had a contrasting experience where they have struggled to find opportunities to make friends. I do believe that UofT while it does have a lot of resources (clubs, study groups, events) to induce such things, I would argue that they could do more. 

While I struggled in my first year a lot with my courses (thankfully, I ended the year with a 3.1 cGPA), the second year was a whole different ball game. For my degree, I had to take: MAT235Y1, ECO200Y1, ECO202Y1, ECO220Y1, and some half-year courses. I don't know about you guys, but I find year courses to be more draining than half-year ones. So taking four of them for me was a very big challenge. One course of these courses (I will not name), in particular, made me frustrated with the Economics department. 

There were two sections in that year--for anonymity's sake, there was Professor A and Professor B. Professor A who taught my class was notorious for her treacherous exams whereas Professor B was known for his easy multiple choice exams. Throughout the year, talking to some friends who were in the other section would tell me repeatedly that their course averages on tests were always above a 75. On the other hand, in my course, it was repeatedly in the 60s. This frustrated me that two different sections that are teaching the same exact course material had a grade disparity between them. For me, why was it fair that they got multiple choice on their exams and for my exams, it was all short-answer? I don't blame UofT for this. But for me, it was questionable that there were different standards placed in different sections but for the same course. The rigor just didn't add up for me personally. 

&amp;#x200B;

[An Example from Professor's A class](https://preview.redd.it/lobcd5ksczx61.png?width=1702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad885b63337f1b2cc62a4370807b1363b704d144)

I must digress a little bit now,  I have to admit that I had my own faults in this scenario. I should have studied more and organized my schedule better that year. My grades throughout that year suffered tremendously as I was under a lot of stress. However, I do feel indignant still about the different standards (and in hindsight, I should have gone with the other professor). Again, this is not just at UofT. This is common throughout every university and these are just my own sentiments about this system.

However, one class I took that year, CSC\*\*\* made me extremely upset. I was averaging above a 70 the entire semester and when it came down to the final, I failed due to taking it when I was very sick (an unusual circumstance). This led to me FAILING the course. Why? Even though it was only worth 20% of my total grade, if you fail the final--you fail the course. How come? Why if you fail the final must you fail the class? I know this is not the only course that does this (e.g. SPA100Y1) but this standard is just logically wrong. I remember I asked the professor why this was the case, and he replied saying that if you can't pass a test that captures the entire course material, then you shouldn't pass the course (this is in my own words of course). But for me, why do they neglect all the efforts we exerted throughout the semester? Why can't they consider extenuating circumstances? (Admittedly for this question, they have majorly transformed over this pandemic. Many professors have become very understanding and flexible now). 

This is when the imposter syndrome really came in. Taking four full-year courses and failing one-half year one, my GPA went from a 3.1 down to a 2.1. *I was devastated.* I panicked and used the grade calculator to see if I got As in every course for the next two years if I would get back to above a 3.0. I wouldn't. I wouldn't even come close. I didn't know what to do as I felt that now, I wouldn't be able to get a summer internship and I would continue to fail. Guess what? I didn't get a summer internship in the field I wanted (but I got *experience*) and I didn't continue to fail.

In my third-year and fourth year, I consistently got As and Bs across the board. I attribute this to the fact that a) there are more specialized courses geared towards your independent passions and b) the professor-to-student ratio is significantly smaller. Not only that, I organized my schedule. Instead of cramming before exams and assignments, I would study almost every day (even if it was 30 mins--just a little counts). I found that allocating time to each one of your courses almost every single day (and taking breaks of course) made assignments and exams more tolerable--and moreover, my stress levels decreased *dramatically.*  

I guess the point of me writing this post is to let you know that grades aren't everything. I know that this is a very basic, generic saying but it is very true when you come to terms with it. This whole post was me venting out my sentiments towards UofT but at the end of the day, looking back, it never achieved anything. All I needed to do, was change my mindset and attitude. Agreeably, I do believe the system is unfair but when it comes down to it, it is really your own problem and it is what you make of it that counts. 

I won't deny there were countless nights of anxiety attacks and crying during my experience at UofT. It was extremely difficult, sometimes insurmountable, and definitely trying. But my indignant feelings towards these situations hindered me, as I was focused on ""how unfair UofT was"" instead of how much I could get out of UofT. And now that I have graduated, I can say that I feel extremely accomplished and it wouldn't be that case if I didn't go to UofT. 

I also want to say that while grades are numbers that determine your cGPA, it does not determine you as a person. Remind yourselves that UofT is a beautiful campus (during the good weather times) and enjoy it. Bring your friends to College Circle after class and enjoy a conversation. Go out to college bars (or other forms of fun activity) on the weekend after studying the whole week! Reward yourself for being at a tough school and making it work so far! That in itself is an accomplishment. 

Remember that university is only four years but it is four years of your youth. Please, please, please enjoy these years and make memories as you only get to do it once (when you're young). You can trust me when I say that making *the most of university is making the most of your experiences*. 

Considering that I am graduating this semester, this will be my last post on this Reddit. I wish you all the best in your studies and remember that you are not alone in this journey :)",0.0

All the best to everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

Some background - 

I was worried that my application might get rejected as I completed my practicums (4 months + 8 months) without a co-op work permit. At the beginning of my program, I asked my program coordinator about getting a letter from them to apply for a co-op work permit. They informed me that I did not need a co-op work permit for my practicums as it is unpaid and it is different from an internship or co-op, and this was confirmed by the international student centre. I also tried calling the IRCC several times to confirm this but couldn't get through (it kept hanging up on me) and I eventually took their word for it. 

I didn't think about this until I stumbled on to someone's post with a similar situation back in 2013, and I went to my school's international student centre to ask again, who forwarded me to the main campuses' international student centre. They then informed me that I did need a co-op work permit to complete my practicum as it occurs during the regular academic semesters (fall, winter), which means that my practicums were considered unauthorized work. 

I went back to my program coordinator who provided me with a letter indicating how many hours I completed for my practicum (they refused to provide me with a letter explaining that they were informed that a co-op work permit was not required), and I also provided a letter of explanation for what happened. Interestingly, the Completion of Studies Letter from my school indicated on the letter that I did not complete an internship or work practicum, which makes my situation even more confusing. I might have been overthinking things at the time but this has been a really stressful period for me. Super glad that my application was approved!",0.0
188,"Before you comment “you had a choice to come here”. What we’re asking for is for GYM FEES TO BE REFUNDED. A CLEAR OUTLINE OF THE PROCESS OF HOW TO COME BACK. 

You mean to tell me that the University or UTSU doesn’t see it to be in their job descriptions to tell international students how to safely return. Also, when Trudeau decided to impose a $2000 fee for a 3-day stay in hotels for quarantine. There was absolutely NOTHING from the University. Not one tweet, email, newsletter, nothing. And the student unions - is it not your job to advocate for students? Didn’t y’all act like you campaigned for mental health and well being? Do you not think an additional $2k stress on top of flight fees, school fees would not directly lead to worsened mental health?

189,"This is a bit long so apologies. 

I'm an international student who filed my first tax return in Canada for 2019 as a resident. I arrived in August 2019 and made a small amount through freelancing (around $5000 or so) for the calendar year.

Now I made a mistake with my 2019 tax return by not putting my date of immigration (August 2019) in my tax return. I filed an amended tax return but the software I used apparently messed up and the CRA didn't register my immigration date. Because of this, the provincial tax which I owed (around $74) wasn't recorded.

I contacted the CRA and they told me to send a letter to the Sudbury tax center which I did in the first week of June to correct the immigration date. In the meantime, I have paid the $74 on My CRA account. It is currently under **Unallocated Funds**. But as of now, I am assumed to be a longtime resident of Canada.

Now I am also due for GST/HST credit payments as well as the Ontario Trillium benefit starting in July. Given my income, I do seem to qualify for these two (at least for the Ontario Sales Tax Credit which is $313). However, I never filled out a **GST/HST Credit Application for Individuals Who Become Residents of Canada** form.

So here are my questions. Would really appreciate if someone can clarify these things for me.

**1)** For the $74 provincial tax that I have paid, should I just keep it as unallocated funds or should I ask a CRA agent to move it to my balance so that when my immigration date is corrected, they will know that I have already paid it and not charge me anything for a late payment in case the issue doesn't get resolved before the payment deadline? Keep in mind, I have paid the federal taxes that I have owed and my balance is currently $0.

**2)** Could changing my immigration date to the correct one possibly affect the GST payments and Trillium benefit amount? For the latter, I used the tax credit calculator and the amount seems to be correct without checking or asking when I became a resident. For the former, it does say: **You are generally eligible for the GST/HST credit if you are considered a Canadian resident for income tax purposes the month before and at the beginning of the month in which the Canada Revenue Agency makes a payment.**

**3)** If it won't affect the amount, should I complete and send the GST/HST Credit Application
for Individuals Who Become Residents of Canada form? What happens if I do it after receiving the GST credit?

**4)** What do you suggest I do with the payments I will be receiving? I haven't set up direct deposit so I will be receiving these cheques soon. Given that I am eligible for both, should I just hold on to them for now and wait for my immigration date to be fixed (as well as send the GST/HST Credit Application for Individuals Who Become Residents of Canada form?) What will happen once the immigration date is corrected and the system finds that I shouldn't have received these payments as I didn't fill out that form?

Sorry for so much text. Just a bit stressed with this whole situation which only began because of SimpleTax not recording my immigration date. Thanks in advance!",0.0

has anyone in this subreddit applied for their PGWP from London, UK? How long did it take?

has anyone in this subreddit successful applied for a work permit / visa from a country they were just visiting? 

Full explanation:
Hi everyone. I’ve asked this question before but didn’t really get any answers so I want to give it another shot as my situation is currently giving me a lot of anxiety. 

I’ve been an international student in Canada for 5 years (1 year high school + 4 years uni). I just graduated from university and due to COVID-19 restrictions, cannot enter Canada at the moment because my travel is not seen as ‘essential’. My documents expire in September and I have a time limit to apply for PGWP so I need to get on it ASAP. 

I’m a citizen of an African country (btw, my country is a big MESS) and the processing time for work permit here says 32 weeks and I know people who have had to wait longer for their documents. 

I have a valid visitor visa to the UK and was already planning to visit my brother this summer (he’s graduating with master’s and I haven’t seen him in 2 years). 

I see that the processing time in the UK is 5 weeks which is considerably shorter, and so I’d really be interested in applying here. 

I’ve read up on situations like this on Canada website and I see that it is possible (I just have to explain why I’m applying from there). 

But it’s always better to consider first hand experience so I want to know 2 things -

192,"Ok so real talk RU, are we even considered in planning? Now I know we make up about 10% which is minority of the student population at Rye and I am surprised to see there is not even a single post taking about it. Even if there is, like in the news, it usually gets brushed off. 

I know these are uncertain times for us all. But at least having a clear sense off direction reduces the added stress with a yes or no. We have been and are considered as a problem now more than ever. It is at a [government level](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-responds-ford-criticism-borders-1.6054259) as shown by the Ontario Premier, Doug Ford and that's the sad reality.

It is really frustrating. I know couple of students who lost internships/placements just because of travel ban announced overnight for people coming from Pakistan and India. There are students who are paying for their housing which are empty just because they signed lease. Some of us are not considered academically when it comes to time zone differences. We pay for our health insurance but those who were supported medically can not be further supported just because they are abroad. If we are stuck financially or need support during this time of the year, there are literally no contingency plan by Ryerson for international student (IS). 

Now reflecting prior and to F2020, yes most of us chose to go back. Family, health and finance were probably the top most priority in though times for us all. [Ryersons DLI status](https://ryersonian.ca/international-students-located-abroad-remain-ineligible-to-return-to-ryerson/) was revoked by the government in light of COVID19 until they represented a COVID19 Readiness Plan accommodating international students, which unsurprisingly was [delayed](https://theeyeopener.com/2020/11/rye-international-students-permitted-to-travel-to-canada-after-weeks-of-waiting/) by the University. June 8th, 2021 was probably the big day for us all as students to [hear about the upcoming semester](https://www.ryerson.ca/news-events/news/2021/06/a-message-from-president-lachemi-on-planning-for-fall-2021/) but sadly it was just buzz words typed into one document and slapped on internet without an actual plan. I might be wrong but I am sure most of us feel the same way.

**So far this is what we can extract of all the public communications by the Ryerson University (RU).**

IS: Will the university resume in person?  
RU: Well partially - check with the department.  
IS: Ok, but they are slow af. But sure we can wait, would we need to fly back?  
RU: Uh, no idea for now. Also if you need to we can not facilitate you, but just keep paying us the hefty tuition fee and you should be good. We promise to provide ""Exceptional Student Experience"".  
IS: Do we need to be vaccinated if we are coming? Also which ones are accepted?  
RU: Probably. Hold on to that.  
IS: Well, there are 2 doses with at least a month apart and its June 2021 already........additionally there is shortage where I am..  
RU: You ask to many questions. Stay optimistic.  
IS: huh?

**TLDR:** We need an international student focus support by the University more than ever. Now yall might say, you have International Student Support (ISS) for that.

195,"Hi,
So this might be a bit of a long shot but I am looking for some info on Canadian universities and how to enrol as an international student. 

But before that, here’s a little summary:
Basically, I am Portuguese but I grew up in England. I did secondary school there and eventually passed all my GCSE’s. I then went on to do a BTEC 90 credit course. However, I struggled a lot with depression in my teens, which has led me to drop out of school entirely. Unfortunately, I didn’t finish my course, meaning I didn’t get my secondary (high) school diploma. Now here I am some 4 years later at the age of 22, without a diploma but in a much better mental state. I have recovered from depression, and I’m full of life again. So I would love nothing more than to pick up where I left off. 

Now, I’ve been really interested in studying in Canada for some time now. This is due to the fact that I for 
1. Want to live and study in an English speaking country
2. The UK currently sucks (not going back anytime soon, thanks brexit)

So I’ve been Googling a bit but to no avail. I mean there’s not really any website that explains how to apply to an international uni without having a secondary school degree, after being away from any sort of education for almost 5 years. Or is there? 
That’s what I came here to ask, although I don’t know if this is the appropriate subreddit. Do redirect me if there’s a better place to ask such questions. Anyway, I was wondering if maybe any of you had any idea on where I could possibly inform myself on the matter? I’d really appreciate it. 

I don’t know if this helps but I am currently living in Luxembourg, and I am fluent in English obviously. I’m also mostly interested in humanities (History, English), and or education/teaching.

Thank you so much for any answers in advance :)",0.0
196,"Today, I saw a Piazza post on the CSC148 course discussion board talking about the fairness of CS POSt admission for out-stream students. Below are my reply to the Piazza post and my thoughts on the CS POSt admission process for our-stream students.

*Processing img ft3q2it5d9q61...*

Before I start, I want to say that this is all my personal opinion, and I do not mean to attack anyone in the CS Department or UofT personally. In fact, I really appreciate the effort and time they have put in to create a good learning experience in this stressful year.

My situation may be somewhat different than yours, but I totally understand your feelings and your struggles. I started learning to code when I was in elementary school. I dedicated a lot of time to learning computer science and created many projects over the years. It has always been my dream to become a computer scientist. However, I also found my passion in biology so I decided to study bioinformatics as well as computer science. I was not aware of the ""admission stream"" policy for CS admission, so I ended up applying to the Life Science program, thinking that it would make it easier for me to get into bioinformatics. But no, it did not, and I have to admit, this is fault on my part. I should have learned more about the admission process before applying. Even though I still believe to this day that should I applied through the CS admission stream, I would have got in. But again, I made a mistake, I screwed up. However, the point that I want to make from my story is that nobody should be forced into thinking that one mistake they made would affect their entire academic career or even worse, their future.

But UofT definitely made it feel like that. Not only did they create a toxic environment with a lot of unnecessary stress for out-stream students, but they also appeared to be dismissive of such issues. They are dismissive that their system was unfair; and more importantly, they are dismissive of student's mental health. When I called the CS Department and the Faculty of Arts and Science last summer about program admission, I was literally told, ""If you didn't get into the computer science admission stream, it is very unlikely that you will get into the CS POSt because it is very competitive, and if you really want to get into CS, you can try to drop out and reapply as a freshman next year."" 

Yes! They really said that. I was distressed and feeling hopeless. I got into my dream school, with an admission scholarship, as an international student, but was told to drop out. They really think I did not get into the CS admission stream because I was incompetent because I was dumb or something. Well, I wouldn't say that I am smart or anything, but I'm pretty sure I am not incompetent either. I will not reveal the name of the officer who said that to me. To be honest, I probably don't remember that either. But I think, and I think most people can agree with me that nobody should ever be treated like that; students who genuinely spent their time and effort should never be said words like that.

I do not want to be inconsiderate, and I want to reassure you that I appreciate the effort put in by the department. I also want to express my understanding of their reasoning for the competitiveness of the selection process. But students are also human. Not only should we be treated fairly, but we also need to be treated ""humanely"". Right now, the entire POSt admission is just like a black box to us. We don't know what factors come into play when they select students; we don't know what grade do we need to get in order to get into the program. Some may argue that college admission is just like that, with a lot of uncertainties. But, WE ARE NOT APPLYING TO A COLLEGE. We are already students at U of T. We spent our time and effort in high school; we proved ourselves by getting into U of T. Why are we supposed to somehow prove ourselves again? Why is it okay to assume that out-stream students are dumb or treat us like second-class citizens?

I don't expect anything to change for this year's applicants, and the best I can do now is to try my best in all classes. But moving forward, I do believe that this is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed.

And by the way, if the department really thinks high school grades are somewhat more indicative of my ability to do well in CS, I am glad to share my high school transcript and prove myself. Oh, also, I took Data Structure and Analysis course (equivalent to CSC263) in high school and got an A+ (and yes, I did get transfer credit for that), and I'm taking CSC240 with an above-average grade. Does that somehow change the stereotype that out-stream kids are dumb?

Also, I did not write this post just to flex about how smart or complain about how unfortunate or mistreated I am. I just want to raise the awareness that this is indeed a problem.",0.0
197,"2020 MEGATHREAD: Prospective and Incoming Student Questions (All Other Posts Will Be REMOVED)

Hello future McGillians! We know that you have lots of questions, and we're here to help answer them. To keep the subreddit orderly, all that we ask is that you restrict discussion to this megathread. All other posts will be removed.
Before you comment, please read the FAQs below, and note that administrative inquires about requirements, deadlines, financial aid, etc. are best directed to Service Point.
You might also try asking your question here on the McGill website.

How will the COVID-19 pandemic impact me?
The admissions and intake processes are continuing, and McGill anticipates everyone will be able to begin their studies on time.
The deadline to accept an offer is now June 1, and McGill says they understand your final grades may be delayed or in a different format.
The Fall 2020 semester will be conducted primarily online, so you won't need to be in Montreal. Frosh seems unlikely to happen. However, the current indication is that you may choose to live in residence anyways, as some in-person social activities will eventually occur. See the megathread for more information.
International students should still try to get a CAQ and study permit on time, but those documents will not be required to begin classes online from your home country.
If you want to defer an offer of admission, you can do so until July 31, but keep in mind availability is likely to run out sooner rather than later. See here for details.
Updates for applicants can also be found on this webpage.

What are my chances of getting in? When will I receive a decision?
We aren't admissions officers, so we can't tell you anything beyond the general rule that offers are made in waves, based on grades and test scores, until all available spaces are filled. This means that the higher you are above the minimum requirements for your program, the better your odds of acceptance, and the sooner you're likely to hear back.
However, simply being above the minimum requirements is not a guarantee of admission.

If I don't meet the requirements for the program I want, can I get into another program and then transfer?
Transferring into most programs is a lot harder than getting admitted to them in the first place, so while this is a possible route to take, it's a big risk as you would have to substantially improve your academic performance in your first year.

What if I'm accepted with my predicted grades or scores, but then they go down a little?
As long as you pass all of your classes and graduate from your current high school or CEGEP, you'll be fine.

Is McGill better than this other university? Is a McGill degree good for jobs?
Most of us haven't attended any other universities or been in the labour market for very long, so we probably can't give you an informed opinion.

How hard is it to get a high GPA at McGill? I've heard there's grade deflation.
It's hard—McGill will not hold your hand—but it's also perfectly possible to graduate with a high GPA if you take courses that interest you and manage your time efficiently. In other words, your perception of difficulty will vary based on your program and your academic background, such as how good the study skills you developed in high school are.
Different faculties and departments have different policies when it comes to forcibly curving a class's grades down so that there's a certain average (also known as ""grade deflation"").

What is student life like?
Lots and lots has already been said about this topic. Read through some past threads to get some ideas.
Broadly speaking, being in the midst of a city as fun and affordable as Montreal, socializing tends to happen off-campus. There is a visible party culture, so if that's up your alley you will probably find it easier to make friends. However, with 27,000 undergraduates and hundreds of clubs, there is a niche for everyone. You may just have to look a little harder to find yours.
Of course, a big part of life in Montreal is dealing with winter. Seasonal depression is real, so consider your ability to tolerate five months of overcast days with 4 pm sunsets, freezing temperatures (sometimes as low as -30° C with wind chill), and occasional icy sidewalks that make getting to class downright hazardous.

Do I need to speak French to come to McGill?
No. Montreal is a relatively bilingual city, so you can spend four years here and get by without a word of French. However, your life will be much easier and more opportunities will be available to you if you can speak—or make an effort to learn—un peu de français.

I've accepted my offer! What next?
Congratulations! See this page for a full guide to class registration, residences, frosh, and legal documents—including information on visas, banking, and phone plans for international students.",0.0
198,"Hey Everyone, 

I am Abhiraj Lamba and I am running to be a WUSA Math Councillor. I took part in both AMAs yesterday and tried to answer as many questions as possible to the best of my abilities. Since I am currently in a different time zones, I did miss out on answering a few questions and I am sorry about that.

Just wanted to give y'all an overview of my platform :-

1. Increased Mental Health Advocacy - It is no secret that as university students, we are all under constant pressure and stress. It is extremely important for students to take care of their mental health. I currently sit on the university’s Committee on Student Mental Health as the international students’ representative and we have been working on implementing 36 recommendations from a previous committee called PAC-SMH. Currently 75% of these recommendations are complete and the rest are in progress. These recommendations include points like equipping AcessAbility Services and opening a continuous dialogue within campus, for example. Once the mandate of the committee ends in April, WUSA will be one of the many organisations responsible for seeing all the completed recommendations through. As a WUSA Councillor, I will be able to actively play a part in ensuring that all these recommendations continue serving their intended purposes.

For more information regarding CoSMH recommendations: [https://uwaterloo.ca/mental-health-wellness/progress-dashboard](https://uwaterloo.ca/mental-health-wellness/progress-dashboard)  


2. Safer and More Inclusive Campus for ALL Students - The health and safety of all students must be a priority. This means not only do we have to hold the university accountable for how the students feel. We must also compel the university to hold students accountable for their actions which go against this ethos.  


3. Being YOUR Voice - As my campaign slogan (""Here To Hear You"") makes it clear, the most important thing for me is to be your voice. This means that I promise to personally make an effort to understand what my constituents (you) want and need, and raise my voice with their case. I promise to be YOUR representative in every sense of the word! I have pledged to host a weekly office hour, if elected, open to all undergraduate math students, so that they can share their concerns with me. I will have a 24 hour email policy, i.e. any email I receive will be responded to within 24 hours. I would push for a mailing list access to be given so that particular agenda points can be discussed with students.

However, most of these issues would not be enough to engage and communicate with Students. To combat this, I will be pushing for a Math caucus public town hall twice a term. That is, if elected, I would be discussing and working on implementing with my fellow Math Councillors, a Town Hall for Math Students to attend and bring forward their concerns to their representatives. (If this implementation goes well, we can get other caucuses to follow suit)

So do vote for me in the elections tomorrow.

199,"\[30, M, Canada\] - I'm an international student finishing up my PhD soon in Waterloo, Ontario. Since COVID, I have been very stressed and now that I'm getting closer to my PhD defense, stress level is off the charts! :) Making things worse is that I tend to be very private in real life, and don't like to open up to friends or family about emotional issues, not that I could now with the COVID isolation.

I have never had a pen pal before, and like I said, I'm a fairly closed book in person. But I want to have a person to share and process things with, and also be there for you and hear from you. I want this to be a long term penpalship (if this is a word) that continues after COVID is behind us and life is less stressful.

&amp;#x200B;

Topics:

I'm open to talking about anything. My research is related to artificial intelligence, and we could talk about that, but I'm not particularly looking for academic correspondence. We can talk about the small things, things that stood out in our days, made us happy for a bit, or weighed on us. We can have philosophical discussions and discuss world events. We can talk about cultural trends.

I have been trying to get back into reading, we can talk about books, exchange recommendations.

I'd like to learn a 3rd language one day (English isn't my native language). I've started learning Mandarin Chinese, but it's so hard! We can talk about languages.

We can talk about anything! I'm sure that in the beginning, neither of us will be comfortable to spill the beans, as it were, about everything in our lives. But I'm hoping that we grow to trust each other. The point is to be supportive of each other, not judgemental or critical. 😊 

&amp;#x200B;

Channel:

I have always wanted to send and receive hand-written letters. I remember my older brothers, pre-internet, used to send home letters when they were away in college. The content of the letters wasn't particularly beautiful but the process definitely was! I wish we could do physical mail at some point. But, as a start, I hope we can keep it anonymous (no addresses, no identifying info, eg,. full names, no phone numbers). So, maybe email?

If we build trust over time and show commitment to the penpalship, and we both feel comfortable, we can explore physical mail one day!

&amp;#x200B;

About you:

I'm happy to talk to all people all over the world, but I feel we'll have a better chance of syncing if we're in similar circumstances (eg., similar age range, in grad school).

200,"Hey everyone \~ 

Starting my first semester in Sept. Like many of you, I'm planning on transferring to UBC to complete a Bachelor of Arts. I'm trying to make sure I have all the courses that I need at Langara, so that there's no surprise stress down the line. My fear is that I'll miss something and then have to take a bunch of pre-req's to catch up.

For an Arts degree, there is a Science requirement. 

1) When I looked on the Transfer Guide for BIOL 1111 and CHEM 1117...it said that it transfers, BUT ""Not for credit in Science"". That means it will count as the science requirement for Arts students, but just not for Faculty of Science students...right?

2) For the Science requirement, it can just be any 2 transferrable science courses in first year, right? So it's not like I have to take a science course in first year, and a science course in second year. It's just 6-8 credits whenever.

3) I'm waitlisted for a course I need for my program, and the amount of ""reserved spots available"" has gone down, but my waitlist position has not. Does that mean they are taking people who aren't in line?  I guess it's spots specifically for international students or something?

201,"I just want to say this to all the professors lurking here.

The world is going through a pandemic right now, show some sympathy.  Be humans first and professors after that. Going through all the hurdles for online proctorship, video recording, storing your video data for 3 months, shortened exam time, harder exams, is all ridiculous. Students are devastated, worried and anxious. There are students who are worried for their parents, many students have immunocompromised parents that put them at a much higher risk and they have to take care of them.  Many many parents and even students have lost jobs, putting food on the table has become a bigger priority for some of them. There are many students who don't even have webcam and getting one at this point is very hard (most are sold out online). Now if you don't have a webcam, you are told to defer the exam, this adds unnecessary stress. It's just childish to put video proctorship, shorter time tests, differing exams over humanity first.  


I am totally against academic dishonesty so don't take this post as a promotion of that. I also think it's unrealistic to be expect the same performance from students during this time.  I think an open book test is a much more reasonable option for most classes. Professors are making exams like students are performing at their full potential, but this is totally untrue. Most students are probably going to perform at half or 60% of their potential. It's just the time that is right now, and it's good to see many professors adapt to it and I hope more can follow.  


Many amazing professors have understood the situation and have adapted to an open-book, and reduced the weightage of the exams, which I think is the right thing to do. Being lenient one semester isn't going to break anyones career or reputation but it will help so many students, it's the humane/right thing to do. I am hoping more professors will do the same.  


NY Times wrote an article today on how all students should potentially be given the pass, it's an interesting perspective and makes some really good points.

**Snippets**:

“The reality is, there are people who will not pass their classes, there are people who will not finish the semester, who will not graduate on time,” Mr. Polanco said. “The most vulnerable will be drastically harmed.”  


The concern that professional schools might look askance at a “pass” grade from undergraduates might prove to be overblown. A Yale spokeswoman said the university’s professional schools would not hold pass/fail grades against applicants, whether the choice to forgo letter grades was theirs or the institution’s. And the medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, said it would accept pass/fail marks “without prejudice” for classes taken during the pandemic.  


“The reality is that the performance of students this semester is not only going to reflect the mastery of a subject,” Prof. Danheiser said, “but also could be impacted by differences between students due to their different health situations, the health of their loved ones, different access to technology, different home situations.”

I hope everyone does well on their exams. Stay safe and take care of people around you. This is a lonely time for a lot of people, especially for all the international students. Reach out to all your friends and especially ones you think may need help.

So the worst has come and I have failed two of my courses, which policy dictates means I will be dropped from my program. I do have the chance to appeal it, and i will be for the following reasons:
- issues getting my ADHD meds meant i spent a month mid semester off my meds, and there is record of me trying to get it throughout and being bounced around 
- extreme depression and anxiety to the point of a near complete mental breakdown, something I also tried repeatedly to get help for and was bounced around for weeks before receiving help
- attempts to recieve disability accommodation w the OSD were similar drawn out and never actually implemented, with the exception of extra time on one exam, which was requested by me and granted by my professor because they never got around to officially registering me 
- as an international student who moved here in january at the height of restrictions and live alone, i have been completely isolated and unable to socialize, worsening the depression
I have a ton of records showing I have been attempting to address these issues and that the school was slow to help. I know exceptions are very rare, but I guess i'm here asking if people have ever seen a similar situation/think i have a shot? Let me know, I REALLY dont want to leave.",0.0

CMHC is expecting house prices [to drop anywhere from 9% (best case scenario)  to 18% (worst case scenario)](https://twitter.com/ewsiddall/status/1264274394408509446). 15% of mortgages [(700,000 - bank mortgages only)](https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/big-six-banks-report-earnings-mortgage-deferral-cliff-loan-losses)  are in deferral; that could be 20% by September.

WHO warns [there is a potential for a second peak](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-health-organization-warns-second-peak-areas-where-covid-19-n1214406) and we are [1 year away from vaccine at best](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-clinical-trials-1.5580436). There is no clarity regarding when and how will the traveling/immigration resume and [investors from China are already revising their desires to live in the West](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3085758/coronavirus-wealthy-chinese-families-say-pandemic-has-eroded). 

Basically, while there are  a lot of ""glass is half-full"" optimists out there (a lot of them have interest in keeping prices afloat), we are getting extremely close to the day of reckoning in the form of huge house sell-off and debt level adjustment. [When this happened in U.S. in 2008, it not only triggered a world-wide recession, but also allowed Wall Street to sweep $60 billion worth of housing:](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/magazine/wall-street-landlords.html) 

&gt;*By 2016, 95 percent of the distressed mortgages on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s books were auctioned off to Wall Street investors without any meaningful stipulations, and private-equity firms had acquired more than 200,000 homes in desirable cities and middle-class suburban neighborhoods, creating a tantalizing new asset class: the single-family-rental home. The companies would make money on rising home values while tenants covered the mortgages.* 

With all of the QE going on and extremely cheap credit, what we are about to experience soon is deflation (due to low demand prices on average goods will remain flat or fall, dragging down wages) coupled with reflation (money printing will balloon asset prices - stocks, revenue-generating vehicles and, of course, housing). This will mean that your average Joe will be priced out, but Wall Street-based institutional and wealthy individual investors (domestic and foreign) will have all the cheap money to snatch the real estate while it's cheap and rent it out to the masses, making an already almost-impossible homeownership dream literally impossible (an individual can't compete with wealth management funds in terms of wealth). Lending will be tight for individuals, but there's always a pool of cash to lend to a corporation backed by RE (and even when lending is not an option, stock market can finance those purchases).

Some might think that having an institutional landlord own their home is a good thing, but practical example shows that ""residential RE as an asset"" is a very questionable practice in terms of ethics:

&gt;*...Before 2010, institutional landlords didn’t exist in the single-family-rental market; now there are 25 to 30 of them, according to Amherst Capital, a real estate investment firm. From 2007 to 2011, 4.7 million households lost homes to foreclosure, and a million more to short sale. Private-equity firms developed new ways to secure credit, enabling them to leverage their equity and acquire an astonishing number of homes. The housing crisis peaked in California first; inventory there promised to be some of the most lucrative. But the Sun Belt and Sand Belt were full of opportunities, too. Homes could be scooped up by the dozen in Phoenix, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Sacramento, Miami, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Denver — places with an abundance of cheap housing stock and high employment and rental demand. “Strike zones,” as Fred Tuomi, the chief executive of Colony Starwood Homes, would later describe them....*   
&gt;  
&gt;**.*****..Ellingwood was soon*** *paying more in rent than he had paid for his first and second mortgage combined. When he owned the house, the most he paid was $3,300 a month. Strategic and later Colony American increased his rent from $3,500 to $3,800 in just a few years. (Strategic did not respond to questions about Ellingwood’s tenancy or that property.) In August 2017, Waypoint increased it again to $4,150 (a 9.2 percent year-over-year increase — nearly five percentage points higher than the already-burdensome city average). And that didn’t include fees. When Colony took over from Strategic, it introduced an online payment portal. All tenants were required to use it — and using it cost a $121 “convenience fee.” “It was anything but convenient,” Ellingwood told me. After submitting the payment, which went to the national office, the tenants, he told me, were obligated to call the local office to report it. Once, a landscaping charge appeared on his bill, even though no one was landscaping his property. Three months later, a worker showed up at his house for the first time and asked him to sign a work invoice. Ellingwood refused. (He was able to get the fee removed.) But the fees, many of which were outlined in his lease, kept coming: lawyer fees, utilities conveyance fees, pipe-snaking fees. In 2015, Colony emailed about a lease renewal, asking him for a new security deposit and inquiring whether his appliances had been included in his original lease, as if to suggest he should be paying a fee for them. “I bought these appliances,” Ellingwood told me. He emailed back: “I have receipts.”...*  
&gt;  
&gt;*...One of the first times he was late, a notice of eviction was posted to his door. He paid the rent — and the $50 late fee. But three days later, there was another pay-or-quit notice — this time because he hadn’t paid a $35 delivery fee for the late-fee notice. The second eviction notice, in turn, incurred a second $35 delivery fee. Over the years, he amassed a stack of late fees, more than 40 of them. “It’s embarrassing,” Ellingwood told me, handing over the stack. Three-quarters of the time, he was late because he didn’t have the money in the bank. One-fourth of the fees were incurred because he was frustrated; he wanted to put pressure on a company that he felt invested nothing in the upkeep of its properties.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*After taking Ellingwood to court in Santa Monica in 2013, his landlords filed for eviction two more times over late payments. Struggling with the almost 10 percent rent increase, Ellingwood was late but caught up a couple of weeks before his court date. He paid not only the rent, but $200 in late fees, $70 in notice fees and a $710 legal fee. A tenant is charged the moment Waypoint or, later, Invitation Homes emails its lawyers to initiate an eviction, whether the company’s lawyers do work or not. (Kristi Des­Jarlais, a spokeswoman for Invitation Homes, says that the company follows “local laws and practices on all legal proceedings.”) According to Ellingwood, Waypoint thanked him and told him he didn’t need to appear in court. Waypoint, however, never canceled the hearing. Its lawyers showed up, and when the judge marked Ellingwood absent, Waypoint was granted a summary judgment for eviction. Waypoint sat on that judgment until the next time Ellingwood was late: Then the company didn’t bother to post a three-day eviction notice; Ellingwood said it sent the sheriff. Fortunately, Ellingwood had learned from his high-conflict divorce to document everything, and after the sheriff reviewed his emails with Waypoint, he told Ellingwood to get a lawyer.*

As you can see, the outcome is pretty grim. While QE was supposed to support companies and enterprises and only impact stock markets, part of this money-printing eroded the housing market, essentially out-pricing millions of people from something that is considered to be a basic necessity. 

The only option I can see is to impose a temporary ban for corporations and investors on hoarding houses. Since we will most likely won't see any international students, immigrants and foreign investors for another year, this ban could be potentially imposed on Sep 1 and last for 12 months.

This is similar to what other countries and governments (Japan, China, Singapore, some EU countries) are doing in order to protect citizens from aggressive/hostile foreign and local investors. As everybody already knows, [real estate contributes the most to Canadian GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Canada#Key_industries), but [hardly anyone thinks it's a great and sustainable approach](https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadian-real-estate-great-reckoning-covid-19). Rebalancing is crucial as in Ontario alone almost 600k are employed in FIRE (realtors, insurance agents, brokers etc) compared to 508k in Education. We all know that no one really needs a second house except for recreational properties (cabins, resort homes), and attempts to run [pseudo-hotels resulted in disaster consequences and legislative backlash.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garybarker/2020/02/21/the-airbnb-effect-on-housing-and-rent/#410d189c2226) Proposed approach will allow to pivot and stimulate more production, innovation and consequently grow stagnating wages, since QE will flow into stock market providing companies much needed liquidity for growth. It will be hard at first, especially to those who are comfortable with the current misbalanced situation, but this has to be done; investors belong to stock markets, not housing. Those who seek stability can invest in gold or commodities, but this comes at a premium of reduced returns.

205,"As you might have read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/geegees/comments/l25c8x/aziz_vs_students_p2_i_dont_have_to_take_your_shit/) post a short while ago, this submission has to do with the incident with Mr. Aziz and his students. 

The students were raising questions regarding the professor's intentions to carry out pop quizzes. There are two main issues that the students are facing. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. 1. Mr. Aziz had mentioned during his first lecture that he will be conducting pop quizzes but failed to provide the mark breakdown of these quizzes. During the first lecture, he also mentioned that if a student does not do well during the semester's assessments but good in the final exam he will not pass the student on the account that they might have cheated. This resulted in students being stressed over the fact that this ""POP QUIZ"" will be accounted for their progress. A week later a mark breakdown was provided (which should be provided during the first lecture) by Mr. Aziz stating that the Pop Quizzes are worth 20% and that the 4 exams (3 midterms and a final) are worth 70%. It was asked if the final exam by itself was worth the same percentage as each exam (17.5% for each exam), and his reply was very vague with no denial. This meant to students that the Pop Quiz itself in total is worth slightly more than the final exam. The students are trying to argue now with this information that they should have some sort of a heads up as these marks are very important as mentioned by Mr. Aziz himself. 
2. 2. Mr. Aziz has mentioned that these Pop Quizzes can occur during a lecture, lab, or tutorial/DGD. The students argue that this does not account for students attending lectures internationally as they might be in different time zones. Most international students in his class mention that they watch the recordings instead of attending classes so they can stay in sync with their local time zone. The students compromise and once again ask that if he was to carry out these Pop Quizzes to give some sort of a heads up so they can attend that instructional period. To which Mr. Aziz in a previous lecture mentioned that it is the student's problem that they live where they are. 

To highlight today's recording was taken from a fellow student's perspective as Mr. Aziz had stopped the recording of the class during question period at the end of class.

Hi! Thanks for doing this AMA. What would you say is the biggest takeaway for a couple based on the results of your study? And is there anything a single person should take from it while looking for a partner? If I'm understanding it correctly, it looks like a lot of the factors that lead to success are things it might not be easy to evaluate until you've actually been in a relationship with someone for a bit. Thank you!|I think the biggest takeaway, to paraphrase my old friend and colleague Geoff MacDonald, is that the person you choose may not be as important as the relationship you build. As a culture, we put so much emphasis on choosing the right person. These results suggest that it’s really more important to be the right person. To create the conditions that will allow a relationship to flourish.
 |In terms of your point about evaluations, this is something I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about myself. Can a relationship be objectively evaluated—are some partnerships inherently better than others--and if so, when do these objective criteria first come online? This is somewhere my students and I would really like to take our research next. We want to recruit couples in brand new relationships and study how they evaluate each other for compatibility and fit, and how those evaluations change as the relationship develops.
 |We were supposed to launch the study in March, but it got stalled due to COVID. Hopefully soon we’ll be able to open the lab up again, and I’ll have some more concrete answers for you.
Did any of your couples include arranged marriages? I ask this because my husband and I both come from cultures with a high degree of parental/community involvement in matchmaking. Without even planning to do so, we did effectively the same thing to ourselves. I told him on our first date (set up by our friend community) that I was only interested in someone who was serious about marriage/kids and he agreed. We operated under the idea that we would do our best to build a healthy relationship that would end in marriage and I think that mindset is key to us having such a happy, healthy, and satisfied relationship now. I would be curious to see if other couples who were in either arranged marriages (willfully) or had a very strong marriage goal early on had the same results as couples who did not.|Not to my knowledge. Our data were from Canada, the US, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Israel, and Switzerland. Very Western-centric, as you can see, so they don't lend themselves well to cross-cultural research questions.
 |Arranged marriages have always intrigued me, and a long-term research goal of mine is to prospectively follow people in arranged marriages and compare their trajectories to the trajectories of self-selected marriages.
 |The existing literature that I know of on arranged marriage--and it's not a very large literature-- has produced pretty mixed findings. Some studies have compared people in arranged vs. self-selected marriages and found no differences in relationship quality. Some have found higher quality for the self-selected marriages. Some studies have shown different results depending on which marital quality measure you use, or on how you define ""arranged"". So it's very much a topic in need of further research.
As a single person looking for a long-term relationship partner....do the results of this study mean I could be happy with literally anybody? Aren't there some people who would be more likely to appreciate me and act in ways that show me they're committed to our relationship? (and vice versa)|That’s really hard to say. One of the limitations of the project is self-selection – we only looked at couples who are already together. We didn’t, say, pair people at random. If we had, we might have found much stronger partner effects. So, there may very well be plenty of people who you wouldn’t match well with, but those people are selected out by the time you enroll in our study.
 |What the results do suggest is that by the time you’re in a sufficiently established partnership to enroll in a research study together, your partner’s traits aren’t very important anymore.
 |Really, we need a lot more research on the early relationship stages—how do these relationship dynamics form in the first place?—to produce a satisfying answer to your question.
Have you found that the partnerships need to have a similar understanding of what the commitment translates to? For example, putting equal effort into maintaining the home, or equal involvement with children. Do any of the studies collect information to confirm or deny the reliability of zodiac sign (eastern and western) compatibility? For participants who had a “type” they were attracted to while dating, did their significant other match that description?|This is one of the more interesting aspects of the findings, IMO – we did not find any evidence for any kind of partner matching predicting relationship quality.
 |The algorithm we were using detects interactions. So if my traits and preferences match with your traits and preferences to predict relationship quality, we should have picked up on that. For example, if Andrea says she likes extraverted guys, and she’s happy with Tom because he’s an extraverted guy, we should have found that putting Andrea’s desired extraversion and Tom’s own extraversion into the same model would have predicted more variance than either on its own. But that’s not what happens. Combining both partner’s variables didn’t predict more variance than just one partner’s variables. So that goes against the idea of matching, similarity, having a type, etc. If there was any matching going on, it didn’t predict how happy people were with their partners.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Very thought provoking. Have you been able to find evidence that predicts the relationship quality? And thank you for doing this AMA!|Relationship-specific variables did a great job of predicting relationship quality. Your own perceptions of the relationship--such as your own sexual satisfaction, how much conflict you think there is in the relationship, and how committed you think your partner is--predicted 45% of the variance in your own relationship quality, at the beginning of the study. These same variables also predicted 18% of relationship satisfaction at the end of the study.
 |And in fact, no other variables added to that total variance explained. Not your traits, not your partner’s traits, and not your partner’s perceptions of the relationship. All of the effects were driven by own judgments about the relationship.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
So, basically, if one is in a relationship and they are making the point to perceive themselves as in a happy relationship, they will be. How much does it matter to the success of the relationship if one perceives themselves positively but the other does not?|That’s a great question. My team and I were surprised that the partner’s perceptions of the relationship predicted so much less variance than own perceptions. Own perceptions of the relationship predicted 45% of the variance in relationship quality, but the partner’s perceptions (measured with the exact same variables!) predicted only 15%.
 |That difference suggests that there’s a pretty big discrepancy in those ratings--how you perceive the relationship is not necessarily how your partner perceives it. It’s not clear at this point what the implications of those discrepancies are, or where they come from, but that would be a great topic for future research. How can two people be in the same relationship, and disagree so much about what it’s like?
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
I'm an extrovert and I've been intensely unhappy dating introverts. So this seems to go against my own experiences, because there's not enough in common between us to keep a relationship going, and I don't feel that they care about me enough to compromise (e.g. they agree to attend game night with me once a month vs weekly).|I think this really highlights that self-selection problem I mentioned—your relationships with introverts may not last long enough to be included in a study like this, which means those data are not part of the results. That’s why I really want to see more data on fledging relationships. I’d love to enroll you in a study at the point when you have just started dating an introvert, and ask you about your experiences over those few ephemeral weeks or months that the relationship lasts before it fizzles out. Those sorts of data are so difficult to collect but I think they’re a really important piece of the puzzle.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Well I've been with my introverted husband for nine years. We've decided just recently that separation is probably the best course of action in the future (neither of us want to make such a large decision right now, in the midst of the world being on pause and both of us being depressed about it).|I'm really sorry to hear that, Transplanted_Cactus.
Why do you think that it's so difficult to predict which relationships will work out well, and which won't? (whether using AI or not) Thanks for doing the AMA!|That’s a great question. I think when it comes to relationship quality and longevity, there are a lot of chaotic processes at work that make long-term prediction difficult. Stressors and life events that come up, idiosyncratic experiences that you might happen to have with your partner, other people who may enter or exit your life and who give you different perspectives and ways of thinking about the partnership, etc.
 |So we can predict the aspects of the relationship that are stable, but they also change over time in unpredictable ways. I think that’s because the changes are largely driven by these kinds of environmental and contextual factors that are very difficult to measure, let alone predict.
^(the below is a reply to the question)|
Dr. John Gottman has been able to predict divorce with 94% accuracy. Check him out, his books are fantastic!|I can't speak to Gottman's books, which I'm sure are fantastic. But, from what I can tell, his claim that he can predict divorce with 94% accuracy comes from this study of 52 couples, published in 1992: https://search-proquest-com.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/docview/614305792?accountid=15115
 |13.5% of the sample had divorced over a three-year period, or 7 couples. After the data were already in hand, the researchers used a discriminant function analysis with nine predictors to predict which couples divorced, with 93.6% accuracy.
 |This model suffers from a statistical problem called overfitting. With a small sample size, and a technique that doesn't use any kind of cross-validation, you can essentially keep adding predictors until you explain close to 100% of the variance. We call that a saturated model. Almost all the variance has technically been ""explained"", but only for the very specific sample that the model was built on. If I went and recruited 52 new couples, and applied this exact same model to those data, the accuracy would likely be much less - likely closer to 86.5% (which is the baseline here - you get 86.5% accuracy if you simply predict that no one gets divorced).
 |Tldr Although I have lots of respect for Gottman, I am incredibly dubious of that 94% claim.
Thanks for doing this Dr. Joel! Very interesting research. What made you think machine learning would be a good way to study the success of romantic relationships?|Well, traditional statistical methods that we use in this field—like regression and multilevel modelling--are really great for delving into the mechanisms or inner workings of a handful of variables. But, they aren’t very good at dealing with a large number of variables at once.
 |The major advantage of machine learning is that it can handle a very large number of predictors, and tell you which ones are really driving prediction, as well as how well they are performing as a group. So, the goal of the project was to take all of the many many variables that have already been examined in separate studies, and make them directly compete for that variance. Which of these hundreds of measures are most important, and when taken as a whole, how well do they perform?
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Really interesting work and I really appreciate the approachable explanations. Out of curiosity, what kind of machine learning are you using? How many features are you starting with and how are those coded?|We conducted the analyses with Random Forests, using the randomForests package in R. Each dataset was collected by a different team of researchers and therefore had different predictors - typically ~50 variables per dataset, which we manually coded into either features of the self or features of the relationship. We also used the VSURF package to initially pair down the number of predictors in each model.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Got it thank you! Why did you choose random forests?|Key advantages: it can handle a very large number of predictors at once, it's able to capture non-linear effects and interactions, and its use of out-of-bag sampling helps to minimize overfitting issues.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Just for clarity, these aren't advantages that are unique to random forests at all. Instead, with a dataset like yours, any choice of standard classical classifier should have performed similarly. The random forest is nice because it lends itself to interpretability of feature importance through the GINI coefficient, and doesnt require a separate feature selector. I'm wondering why you called it AI in the post though? In the machine learning community, we wouldnt call this AI. I'm not sure if you're aware, but the public perception that this kind of thing is AI has been harmful to our field.|Our dependent measure was continuous, so this was random forests built on regression trees, rather than classification trees. But yes - plenty of other ML methods likely would have done a fine job.
 |The decision to put ""AI"" in the title was made by the media team in order to shorten the title. Although it's technically correct, I do agree with you that it's a stretch. ""Machine learning"" is a more accurate descriptor.
Do these factors change in order of importance with age? Is there any set of factors that predicts divorce?|In fact, age was one of the only demographic variables that performed well in our models. Age contributed to 68% of the models we tested. Now, machine learning is pretty black boxy, so we can’t tell you exactly what age is doing in these models. But it’s quite possible that it’s a moderator of a lot of the other variables—that different variables are important for relationship quality depending on your age.
 |We did not try to predict divorce or breakups in these models. Other papers have done that though, although not with machine learning. Karney &amp; Bradbury 1995 (https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1995-36558-001 ) is, I believe, still the most comprehensive paper to date on the predictors of divorce. Le et al 2010 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-6811.2010.01285.x?casa_token=pSw5wWgnZSYAAAAA%3ANGeIEDkDNcUmWWi4XiZN1gXDX4F8zMGP98V_O7sWkaW-Z8N0XZ0IuoJNoaSWAwHlZstwN_18X99JT8WQ) is the best paper on predictors of breakups.
 |Top predictors of divorce and breakups tend to be global evaluations of the relationship. Variables like how satisfied you are in the relationship, and how committed you are to the relationship. That’s part of why we focused on these outcome variables in our project.
Hello, Very interesting findings! What would you suggest single people using tinder etc should make sure to find out early / use in their “screening” process for best possible outcomes?|Insofar as our data can speak to this (which is debatable), I would say you want to look for a partner who seems genuinely interested in you, who is good at perspective-taking with you, and who seems to be responsive to your needs. Someone who makes you feel understood, validated, and cared for. If I was a betting person, I would bet on those things.
How do control for the self-reported nature of the data? I would imagine people would be biased in their description of their current relationship compared to past relationships or the prospect of a future one. More plainly, I would expect Ex's to have a largely negative connotation and re-entering the dating pool requires substantial effort; so I may respond more positively about my current relationship.|Absolutely – people tend to hold a lot of positive illusions about their romantic partners, and to perceive their partners in a highly biased way. But, I think I would push back on the idea that this is something that needs to be controlled for or somehow subtracted from the ratings. When we’re talking about relationship quality, really, perception is reality. You’re happy if you think you’re happy! It’s an inherently subjective construct.
 |I think that’s why own traits did such a better job of predicting relationship quality than the partner’s traits, in these analyses. Your own proneness to things like positive and negative affect are going to shape how you perceive your partner and the relationship, and therefore how satisfied you are with that relationship. To a large extent, we project our own personalities, feelings, biases, etc. onto our partners.
Dr. Joel! Really interesting research, I can't imagine the tenacity needed to collaborate and coordinate with so many researchers. Looking forward, what variables do you envision accounting for that initial spark between two people, before an established relationship exists?|My colleagues and I looked at this very question in another project, where we applied machine learning to speed-dating data. These data were collected by Paul Eastwick (key player in the current project), and also by Eli Finkel. They had over a hundred measures in that study, which I fed into the algorithms. But, despite that, we found that we could not predict that initial spark at all. Zero variance explained.

What do you think of the ‘love languages’ and are there any parallels?|The love languages are a really fun and intuitive concept. Unfortunately the scale on the website is, psychometrically speaking, a mess. One of the big problems with it is its forced choice format. It makes you choose between options in a way that artificially exaggerates your preference for one love language over another.
 |I saw a talk by a graduate student once who tried to validate a love languages scale and use it in her research. But when she measured the languages with a Likert scale, she got a huge ceiling effect. Everyone topped out on most of the languages, e.g., most everyone loves hugs, AND receiving presents, AND quality time etc. Basically, she found that everyone speaks every love language.
Are you against the Gottman research that’s been done and widely used as a relationship predictor? How is your work different and how is it the same? Thanks!|IIRC, the Gottman findings you're referring to attempted to predict divorce, using coded interactions that were videotaped in the lab. That's pretty different from our project, which predicted relationship quality with primarily self-report variables. So, we can't directly speak to the veracity of Gottman's findings with these data.
 |I am personally quite skeptical about the claim that divorce can be predicted with 94% accuracy, using any combination of variables. That seems extremely high. The data and code supporting that claim are not available to my knowledge, but I suspect that the models may be quite overfitted to a particular dataset, and would thus have difficulty replicating in a different dataset.
If​ you​ were​ to​ give​ a​ teenager​ an​ advice​ about​ pursuing​ AI​ field, which​ courses​ or​ curriculum​s would​ you​ recommend​ both​ bachelor and​ master​ degree?|This I can't say much about, as I took a pretty serendipitous route to learning about machine learning. My background is in psychology, which includes a lot of statistical training but not machine learning per se. I think it's safe to say that you can't go wrong with programming and statistics courses. If you learn some programming environments like maybe R or Python, and learn about some foundational statistical techniques like regression, that should give you a solid basis of knowledge.
What was your methodology for quantifying which factors are most predictive? Meaning, how did you model the data and how did you establish importance of each variable?|The project included 43 longitudinal datasets. Each dataset included a large questionnaire collected at the beginning of the study (different measures in each study). We organized all measures collected at baseline into traits vs. relationship variables, reported by each partner. Then, we put different combinations of those groups of variables into Random Forests models to predict relationship satisfaction and commitment at the beginning vs. the end of the study. In total, we ran up to 42 Random Forest models on each study, then meta-analyzed the results.
 |The Random Forest algorithm pulls out the most important variables and lists them in their order of strength. It also tells you the total amount of variance explained.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thanks for the detailed response. Where would one be able to look up the details of the study such as how feature importance was computed (I assume based on decreasing node impurity), if results were cross validated (and how folds were created), and what the predictive performance of the classifiers was? I'm interested since the importance of the variables is only meaningful when the model has good generalization performance. I could not find such details when doing a quick keyword search on the paper.|You can find all of the code and detailed results for each dataset here: https://osf.io/g8tm7/
 |These are random forests built on regression trees, not classification trees, so feature importance is calculated based on reduction of the MSE. Results were not cross-validated - instead we relied on the models' out of bag performance (essentially, the technique tests each tree on a sample not used to construct the tree).
What would be more useful for growing a healthy relationship? 1 horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?|Well Dr. MacDonald, taking an academic approach to this question, I would have to say that having 1 horse-sized advisor would likely be more useful than 100 duck-sized advisors.
Did you study partners with open relationships? Do you believe that open relationships can be long lasting and fulfilling? Thank you for all the hard work. It's incredibly intriguing. I'll have a lot to read up on tonight.|This project didn’t really touch on open relationships, but I have done other work in this area. A couple of years ago, one of my students recruited 233 people who were interested in opening up their relationships—but hadn’t done so yet—and tracked them over two months. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550619897157
 |We found no differences in relationship quality between those who opened up over the course of the study and those who didn’t. We did find increases in sexual satisfaction for those who opened up. This is consistent with other, cross-sectional work on open relationships. So, we don’t have definitive answers yet, but so far, the data are looking promising for open relationships!
Hi Dr Joel, Thanks for the AMA. I was reading your paper, and its really interesting, could you please tell me what 'actor' and 'partner' variables/effects are?|""Actor"" refers to the person who's relationship quality we're predicting, and ""partner"" refers to their partner. So, if Andreas and Mary are participating in this study, and we are trying to predict whether Andreas is happy in the relationship, Andreas is the actor and Mary is the partner. When we're predicting Mary's satisfaction, Mary is the actor, and Andreas is the partner. We set the models up this way instead of distinguishing the partners by gender (e.g., husband and wife) so that we can include same-sex couples in the analyses.
So basically, you guys determined that successful relationships are more likely to be successful? I don't mean to be snarky, but how can you say you are predicting how happy people will be with their relationships by essentially asking them, how happy are you with these different aspects of your relationship? This study comes across as more commentary than prediction. The study would be interesting if you could prove that political idealogy, body type, age, religion, upbringing, personality traits are all predictors of varying degree as to whether a relationship will be successful because those are data points that remain somewhat constant before and after the start of a new relationship, and you could then determine how compatible a couple would be together should they choose to pursue a relationship, but the way I am reading this is that you guys basically asked people how happy they were with certain aspects of their relationship, and then said, ""if you are in a good relationship, you are more likely to be happy!"" It should not have taken 43 data sets from 11,000 couples and a machine learning algorithm to figure this out. This is obvious. Sure, maybe people didn't have an exact value to assign to each variable, but it's no secret that if you don't feel your partner isn't committed to the relationship or you aren't sexually satisfied, the relationship is likely doomed. Can you please offer me a rebuttal to this criticism?|I totally get this perspective. But the thing is, it's not science's job to be counterintuitive. Its job is to be robust and accurate, and sometimes reality is just not that surprising.
 |Many of those more ""interesting"" variables you mentioned-- political ideology, religion, upbringing, etc--were in this project. They were measured, they were tested, and they didn't work. This project had hundreds of measures, many of which, it turns out, just aren't that important.
 |For example, take individual differences. Many of these studies included measures of:
 |- education
 |- income
 |- stress levels
 |- anxiety
 |- depression
 |- relationship beliefs
 |- the big five measures (extraversion, openness, etc.)
 |- life values
 |- ethnicity
 |- self-control
 |All that stuff combined, measured from one partner, explained a grand total of 5% of the variance in the other partner's relationship satisfaction. That's it.
 |We preregistered these analyses before we ran them, and were prepared to publish them no matter how they came out. This is how they came out, so this is what we published.
How many of the couples reported being unhappy? Because my experience, compared to what you've answered so far, and what I've read from literally thousands of women on a forum in regards to why they are happy in their relationships, has been entirely opposite of what your data is saying.|Most couples were pretty happy, as is typical of relationship samples. But, the responses did cover the full range of the scale, so there were plenty of unhappy couples in there as well.
 |Hard to say why the results differ from the first-hand accounts you have read. But, the data are the data, and this is what the data showed!
Will the ai ever be released to the public?|Yes! Details of the project, including all of the code and meta-data, are available here: https://osf.io/d6ykr/
What’s your 2nd favorite aquatic creature?|Top favorite is whales, hands-down. Second favorite? Gonna go with dolphins. Cetaceans for the win.
Do you want to develop an app?|I fully, deeply, absolutely do not. https://twitter.com/datingdecisions/status/1288635730336591872
which relationships last longer? the ones with people with different interests or similar interests?|We didn't predict relationship longevity per se. But in terms of predicting relationship satisfaction and commitment, we found no evidence that matching matters in any way. Combining both partner's traits into one model did not predict more variance than one partner's traits on their own.
 |So we found no evidence for the idea that birds of a feather flock together, nor did we find evidence for the idea that opposites attract.
I mean, aren't those factors pretty obvious anyway? Why do we need an algorithm to analyze 11,000 couples to tell us we need decent sex, affection, and trust?|It's a good point - the variables that wound up being important are pretty intuitive. But, many of the variables that didn't make the cut seem intuitive as well. For example, you'll notice that gender is not on the list. There are hundreds of studies on the importance of gender in relationships, and it was measured in every study we had. Yet, it almost never emerged as a predictor.
 |So, I think this is the sort of project where any results would have appeared obvious in retrospect. To me, the surprising findings are not so much the stuff that worked, but the stuff that didn't work. You can see a full list of all the variables tested here: https://osf.io/8fzku/
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Surely that's because (almost) no one for who gender is important enters a relationship with someone who isn't that gender? I'm sure if we could take a group and randomize partners gender - gender preference would emerge as significant. I feel like these results say ""Gender isn't important in a partner as long as you pick the gender you want your partner to be""|Not gender preference, gender. YOUR gender.
 |If relationship satisfaction operates differently depending on your gender--for example, if men and women prefer different things in a relationship--then gender should have emerged as a consistent predictor in our models.
I'm preparing to apply for MSc thesis to research in Western. I am an international student. What would be your suggestion to get in and conduct my research successfully?|This could be a whole other post, but one key piece of advice I have for people applying to graduate school is to spend some time on that research statement. The statement provides an opportunity for you to demonstrate:
 |* Intrinsic motivation (are you confident that graduate school is how you want to spend your next 5-6 years?)
 |* Prior research-related experience (how have you honed your academic interests and skills?)
 |* Research interest fit (is this lab a place where you will be able to conduct the kind of research you want to do?)
 |Also, be sure to do a bit of research into the advisor you're applying to work with and make sure that there's fit there, both in terms of research interests and in terms of their mentoring style.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I've identified two Computer Science professors at Western and reading though their papers and work. So I should have my exact research statement before applying for the University and contacting the professor? Or will I get admission because of my profile and later discuss with my professor to choose a research statement?|You should begin by contacting the professors, briefly explaining your research interests to them and asking if they are accepting students. Then if they are accepting students, you should craft your research statement, which you include as part of your application to the program.
Hey, I'm also from UWO. Do you have any papers published that I could learn further?|Hello, fellow Mustang! A full list of my publications is available on my lab website: http://relationshipdecisions.org/publications/
Have you ever watched Black Mirror, or anything else explaining why this is a bad idea?|Black Mirror is a really nice illustration of the importance of research ethics boards.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I think they were referring to the episode Hang the DJ which I won't spoil but is very pertinent to your work. I came to ask if you had seen this.|Ethics aside, I love the Hang the DJ episode of Black Mirror. It's consistent with my view of relationship compatibility, which is that you cannot predict the quality of a relationship that hasn't formed yet.
Hi! Thanks for doing this ama. Did you study same sex couples? Were there any discernible differences in relationship satisfaction?|Some of the studies had a modest number of same-sex couples, and many studies had sexual orientation as a measure. Neither gender nor sexual orientation tended to emerge as a predictor in the models, suggesting that there probably weren't a lot of differences there. That said, we did not dig into the data and directly test for differences.
So why do you even think that it is possible to predict the future of a couple ? In my experience computers are not very good with predictions. And what are your objective points with wich you feed the ai. And I think that your work is really great and interesting :)|Thank you, Party_Frozy! Certainly, we went into this project prepared for the possibility that we would not be able to predict relationship quality at all. In fact, the last time my colleagues and I embarked on a machine learning project, it was with speed dating data, and we reached exactly this conclusion – we could NOT predict which pairs of individuals would be attracted to each other. (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617714580)
 |So we were pleased to find that we could predict up to 18% of the variance in relationship quality over time. It’s a modest amount, and there’s certainly lots of unexplained variance left there. But it’s more than 0 and that’s exciting!
 |The predictors we used in the model were hundreds of self-reported measures collected from the couples. There was a total of 43 datasets, each of which measured different things. Tons of traits, preferences, relationship judgments, demographic variables, etc. Some more concrete and objective than others.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Why apply machine learning to something as nebulous and subjective as human relationships? Are you interested in applying ML to other areas of social science, or perhaps even the humanities? It seems to me that you're doing some cross disciplinary research. Is your background more in social science or computer science?|My background is in psychology. I'm a relationships researcher, so romantic relationships are really my focus. I agree that relationships are incredibly nebulous and subjective, which is part of why they are so fascinating to me! I think they’re a central part of many people’s lives, so it’s worth pulling out all the methodological stops to try to understand them, empirically.
 |I take a multi-method approach to studying relationships. In other projects I've used videotaped interactions between couples, daily experience studies where we send brief surveys to couples about their relationships each day, longitudinal methods where we track relationships over months or years, etc.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
One of the interesting things about data mining is its ability to find correlations that people wouldn't normally think of. Have you considered adding some objective variables such as height, weight, eye color, frequency of sex, etc., along with people's subjective assessments of the quality of their relationships, how long their relationships last, etc? Or do you do that already?|Many of the variables you listed there were included in at least a subset of the datasets we had. Sexual frequency was commonly measured, and was a decent predictor. Specific physical characteristics (e.g., height, weight) were not measured frequently enough to really say how useful they were. When they appeared, we categorized them as individual differences.
Why can't you predict anything with covid?|Believe me: the COVID research is coming. Many academics are currently studying relationships in the wake of COVID, but collecting data, writing up the results, and getting them published is a very slow process. Expect an explosion of papers in another 1-2 years.
How did you like WesternU? London is a great area.|I've only lived here for two years, but so far I like it a lot! Western is a great place to work- awesome students, and tons of research support. London is a smaller city than I'm used to, but it has a lot of hidden gems. The longer I live here the more it grows on me.",0.0
207,"Hello future McGillians! We know that you have lots of questions, and we're here to help answer them.

To keep the subreddit orderly, all that we ask is that you restrict discussion to this megathread. All other posts will be removed.

Before you comment, please **read the FAQs below**, and note that administrative inquires about requirements, deadlines, financial aid, etc. are best directed to [Service Point](https://www.mcgill.ca/servicepoint).

You might also try asking your question [here](http://ask.mcgill.ca) on the McGill website.

**What are my chances of getting in? When will I receive a decision?**

We aren't admissions officers, so we can't tell you anything beyond the general rule that offers are made in waves, based on grades and test scores, until all available spaces are filled. This means that the higher you are above the [minimum requirements](https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/requirements) for your program, the better your odds of acceptance, and the [sooner you're likely to hear back](https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/nextsteps/decision).

However, simply being above the minimum requirements is not a guarantee of admission.

**If I don't meet the requirements for the program I want, can I get into another program and then transfer?**

Transferring into most programs is a lot harder than getting admitted to them in the first place, so while this is a possible route to take, it's a big risk as you would have to substantially improve your academic performance in your first year.

**What if I'm accepted with my predicted grades or scores, but then they go down a little?**

As long as you pass all of your classes and graduate from your current high school or CEGEP, you'll be fine.

**Is McGill better than this other university? Is a McGill degree good for jobs?**

Most of us haven't attended any other universities or been in the labour market for very long, so we probably can't give you an informed opinion.

**How hard is it to get a high GPA at McGill? I've heard there's grade deflation.**

It's hard—McGill will not hold your hand—but it's also perfectly possible to graduate with a high GPA if you take courses that interest you and manage your time efficiently. In other words, your perception of difficulty will vary based on your program and your academic background, such as how good the study skills you developed in high school are.

Different faculties and departments have different policies when it comes to forcibly curving a class's grades down so that there's a certain average (also known as ""grade deflation"").

**What is student life like?**

Lots and lots has already been said about this topic. [Read through some past threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/search?q=student+life+-flair%3ASSMU&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) to get some ideas.

Broadly speaking, being in the midst of a city as fun and affordable as Montreal, socializing tends to happen off-campus. There is a visible party culture, so if that's up your alley you will probably find it easier to make friends. However, with 27,000 undergraduates and hundreds of clubs, there is a niche for everyone. You may just have to look a little harder to find yours.

Of course, a big part of life in Montreal is dealing with winter. Seasonal depression is real, so consider your ability to tolerate five months of overcast days with 4 pm sunsets, freezing temperatures (sometimes as low as -30° C with wind chill), and occasional icy sidewalks that make getting to class downright hazardous.

**Do I need to speak French to come to McGill?**

No. Montreal is a relatively bilingual city, so you can spend four years here and get by without a word of French. However, your life will be much easier and more opportunities will be available to you if you can speak—or make an effort to learn—un peu de français.

But before that, here’s a little summary:
Basically, I am Portuguese but I grew up in England. I did secondary school there and eventually passed all my GCSE’s. I then went on to do a BTEC 90 credit course. However, I struggled a lot with depression in my teens, which has led me to drop out of school entirely. Unfortunately, I didn’t finish my course, meaning I didn’t get my secondary (high) school diploma. Now here I am some 4 years later at the age of 22, without a diploma but in a much better mental state. I have recovered from depression, and I’m full of life again. So I would love nothing more than to pick up where I left off. 

Now, I’ve been really interested in studying in Canada for some time now. This is due to the fact that I for 
1. Want to live and study in an English speaking country
2. The UK currently sucks (not going back anytime soon, thanks brexit)

So I’ve been Googling a bit but to no avail. I mean there’s not really any website that explains how to apply to an international uni without having a secondary school degree, after being away from any sort of education for almost 5 years. Or is there? 
That’s what I came here to ask, although I don’t know if this is the appropriate subreddit. Do redirect me if there’s a better place to ask such questions. Anyway, I was wondering if maybe any of you had any idea on where I could possibly inform myself on the matter? I’d really appreciate it. 

I don’t know if this helps but I am currently living in Luxembourg, and I am fluent in English obviously. I’m also mostly interested in humanities (History, English), and or education/teaching.

Thank you so much for any answers in advance :)",0.0
216,"I am a returning international student, I have been here since 2018. I am travelling from Mauritius, a country with no active cases for the last 2 months. I am returning since my internship requires me to work from Canada.

What do i have to include in my quarantine plan?
I am currently planning on going back to my apartment. It is a 3 bedroom and the other rooms will be filled. I am planning on asking my roommates to quarantine or vacate if possible, but my housing situation would be a red flag i believe. I will take an uber back there. 

I am pretty stressed about the possibility of not being allowed back in. Is there anything i should know beforehand so I could prepare better? Thank you.",0.0
217,"Hi guys,  
This is a very random post where I would be venting how future students at WLU from India are seeking support but Laurier isn't willing to support in the best possible way.   


I'll explain it to you guys from the beginning. I am an Indian Class XII student of CBSE Board. I received a conditional offer letter from WLU for their BBA program on April 5,2021. The conditions were that I obtain mid 80s (considering we don't get to use calculators) in my CBSE Final Exams.   


During the admission process, WLU asked my high school to provide Predicted scores and those were mid 90s. I presented my transcripts which had high 90s as my past scores (I'm not trying to flex or anything, just want to show you guys my exact problem) which clearly proves that I would very easily meet the conditions of offer.  


Now, due to the massive number of Covid-19 cases and critical shortage of oxygen supplies, medicines and just the whole health crisis, the CBSE Board exams (on which my conditions were based on) are postponed indefinitely. It's been 16 months of Class XII(Senior Year) for us Indian students.   


And this is where my problems are further escalated. As per the latest IRCC guidelines, I had to submit my study permit application by May 15 to get a response in time for Fall 21. Failing to do so, they would do their best to answer us back but can't guarantee within the timelines for Fall. Their requirement for Study Permit is a firm Unconditional Offer Letter or a proof that you have met your conditions and I have none of those. I wrote to Laurier International and Choose Laurier but they said they can't issue an unconditional letter for the study permit but they said that they would not rescind my offer incase I don't get my marks by their July 15 deadline.  


Even if they did issue me an unconditional offer taking into consideration my previous scores which were way beyond the conditions, my predicted scores which were again way more than what I am being asked for and the letter of recommendations from my high school teachers, I would still live with this anxiety if I would be able to make it to Canada this fall or if I would have to take a gap year and defer for September 2022 because I am clearly late to apply for Study permit. Universities like UBC, Carleton, Dalhousie, Ottawa, Guelph and many more have all issued Unconditional Offers for their Indian Students but WLU doesn't seem to care. I feel they could have gone an extra mile for international students like myself who would for sure meet the conditions and would be paying almost 3 times the tuition (aprox $30k a year) than a normal domestic student.  


Hoping that at least the Canadian Consulate would understand the special circumstances we Indian students are in right now would give a thumbs up to applications with conditional offers, I have decided to finally decided to file my application by attaching the email from Laurier to file the application with all the other documents I have.  


I thank any and all of you who read this venting post till the last. I really hope you and your family are staying safe and are in good health. I understand that I might get some hate or criticism for expecting an Unconditional offer or some exemptions in the Study Permit rules but please try to imagine yourself in my position with negativity and health crisis all around and the anxiety if you would be able to make it to University this year even when you yourself know that you could have easily met the requirements of your admission.",0.0

219,"TL;DR: failing out of grad program, appealing on grounds of severe mental health issues that mcgill was at first unhelpful w, wonder if ive got a shot challenging it

So the worst has come and I have failed two of my courses, which policy dictates means I will be dropped from my program. I do have the chance to appeal it, and i will be for the following reasons:
- issues getting my ADHD meds meant i spent a month mid semester off my meds, and there is record of me trying to get it throughout and being bounced around 
- extreme depression and anxiety to the point of a near complete mental breakdown, something I also tried repeatedly to get help for and was bounced around for weeks before receiving help
- attempts to recieve disability accommodation w the OSD were similar drawn out and never actually implemented, with the exception of extra time on one exam, which was requested by me and granted by my professor because they never got around to officially registering me 
- as an international student who moved here in january at the height of restrictions and live alone, i have been completely isolated and unable to socialize, worsening the depression
I have a ton of records showing I have been attempting to address these issues and that the school was slow to help. I know exceptions are very rare, but I guess i'm here asking if people have ever seen a similar situation/think i have a shot? Let me know, I REALLY dont want to leave.",0.0
220,"It just has been so ridiculous how impossible it is to get a psychiatrist in Student Wellness Centre, especially during such a stressful period. Instead of actually polishing their department, I was told that a psychiatrist first took leave and then quit his job, so now the scheduling is ridiculously behind, and that there are people that have been waiting to have a psychiatrist since NOVEMBER. Not only this university milks international students all around, but we didn't even get a cut in prices after things went online. I don't think I'm crazy for thinking that after all that money people shouldn't be spit in the face like this.

Most of the psychiatrists in my home country are terrible and part of the reason I came here a while ago was to get help from student wellness center, since they can't offer services to students outside Canada for some reason. I was assigned a CBT doctor a month ago, and I will still be waiting for weeks to talk to one, and I don't even want to think about when I will actually be seeing a psychiatrist. Not only the transition to online classes has not been handled well but this has been unbelievably difficult for students with mental disorders to begin with. My personal mental health have quadruple worsened since all this happened and I know more students that have had similar problems.

221,"Hi,

I'm a McGill student and they announced about 2 months ago that FALL 2021 will be in-person for us. At first, everyone thought it was a [PR move](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/lqjrzd/mcgill_will_return_to_inperson_teaching_beginning/gogv2sr/) to get incoming students to accept their offers and make the returning students take courses. But now it seems that they are [actually planning](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/muu9sv/mcgill_fall_2021_update_for_inperson_activities/) on having the semester in person, which doesn't seem entirely possible to me and is causing a lot of problems and extra stress for the students (especially international students).

223,"Hey everyone \~ 

Starting my first semester in Sept. Like many of you, I'm planning on transferring to UBC to complete a Bachelor of Arts. I'm trying to make sure I have all the courses that I need at Langara, so that there's no surprise stress down the line. My fear is that I'll miss something and then have to take a bunch of pre-req's to catch up.

For an Arts degree, there is a Science requirement. 

1) When I looked on the Transfer Guide for BIOL 1111 and CHEM 1117...it said that it transfers, BUT ""Not for credit in Science"". That means it will count as the science requirement for Arts students, but just not for Faculty of Science students...right?

2) For the Science requirement, it can just be any 2 transferrable science courses in first year, right? So it's not like I have to take a science course in first year, and a science course in second year. It's just 6-8 credits whenever.

3) I'm waitlisted for a course I need for my program, and the amount of ""reserved spots available"" has gone down, but my waitlist position has not. Does that mean they are taking people who aren't in line?  I guess it's spots specifically for international students or something?

225,"I just want to say this to all the professors lurking here.

The world is going through a pandemic right now, show some sympathy.  Be humans first and professors after that. Going through all the hurdles for online proctorship, video recording, storing your video data for 3 months, shortened exam time, harder exams, is all ridiculous. Students are devastated, worried and anxious. There are students who are worried for their parents, many students have immunocompromised parents that put them at a much higher risk and they have to take care of them.  Many many parents and even students have lost jobs, putting food on the table has become a bigger priority for some of them. There are many students who don't even have webcam and getting one at this point is very hard (most are sold out online). Now if you don't have a webcam, you are told to defer the exam, this adds unnecessary stress. It's just childish to put video proctorship, shorter time tests, differing exams over humanity first.  


I am totally against academic dishonesty so don't take this post as a promotion of that. I also think it's unrealistic to be expect the same performance from students during this time.  I think an open book test is a much more reasonable option for most classes. Professors are making exams like students are performing at their full potential, but this is totally untrue. Most students are probably going to perform at half or 60% of their potential. It's just the time that is right now, and it's good to see many professors adapt to it and I hope more can follow.  


Many amazing professors have understood the situation and have adapted to an open-book, and reduced the weightage of the exams, which I think is the right thing to do. Being lenient one semester isn't going to break anyones career or reputation but it will help so many students, it's the humane/right thing to do. I am hoping more professors will do the same.  


NY Times wrote an article today on how all students should potentially be given the pass, it's an interesting perspective and makes some really good points.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/coronavirus-college-pass-fail.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/coronavirus-college-pass-fail.html)

**Snippets**:

“The reality is, there are people who will not pass their classes, there are people who will not finish the semester, who will not graduate on time,” Mr. Polanco said. “The most vulnerable will be drastically harmed.”  


The concern that professional schools might look askance at a “pass” grade from undergraduates might prove to be overblown. A Yale spokeswoman said the university’s professional schools would not hold pass/fail grades against applicants, whether the choice to forgo letter grades was theirs or the institution’s. And the medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, said it would accept pass/fail marks “without prejudice” for classes taken during the pandemic.  


“The reality is that the performance of students this semester is not only going to reflect the mastery of a subject,” Prof. Danheiser said, “but also could be impacted by differences between students due to their different health situations, the health of their loved ones, different access to technology, different home situations.”

Thanks for making it all the way until the end of the post and I appreciate everyone taking the time to read it.  


I hope everyone does well on their exams. Stay safe and take care of people around you. This is a lonely time for a lot of people, especially for all the international students. Reach out to all your friends and especially ones you think may need help.

227,"This is a bit long so apologies. 

I'm an international student who filed my first tax return in Canada for 2019 as a resident. I arrived in August 2019 and made a small amount through freelancing (around $5000 or so) for the calendar year.

Now I made a mistake with my 2019 tax return by not putting my date of immigration (August 2019) in my tax return. I filed an amended tax return but the software I used apparently messed up and the CRA didn't register my immigration date. Because of this, the provincial tax which I owed (around $74) wasn't recorded.

I contacted the CRA and they told me to send a letter to the Sudbury tax center which I did in the first week of June to correct the immigration date. In the meantime, I have paid the $74 on My CRA account. It is currently under **Unallocated Funds**. But as of now, I am assumed to be a longtime resident of Canada.

Now I am also due for GST/HST credit payments as well as the Ontario Trillium benefit starting in July. Given my income, I do seem to qualify for these two (at least for the Ontario Sales Tax Credit which is $313). However, I never filled out a **GST/HST Credit Application for Individuals Who Become Residents of Canada** form.

So here are my questions. Would really appreciate if someone can clarify these things for me.

**1)** For the $74 provincial tax that I have paid, should I just keep it as unallocated funds or should I ask a CRA agent to move it to my balance so that when my immigration date is corrected, they will know that I have already paid it and not charge me anything for a late payment in case the issue doesn't get resolved before the payment deadline? Keep in mind, I have paid the federal taxes that I have owed and my balance is currently $0.

**2)** Could changing my immigration date to the correct one possibly affect the GST payments and Trillium benefit amount? For the latter, I used the tax credit calculator and the amount seems to be correct without checking or asking when I became a resident. For the former, it does say: **You are generally eligible for the GST/HST credit if you are considered a Canadian resident for income tax purposes the month before and at the beginning of the month in which the Canada Revenue Agency makes a payment.**

**3)** If it won't affect the amount, should I complete and send the GST/HST Credit Application
for Individuals Who Become Residents of Canada form? What happens if I do it after receiving the GST credit?

**4)** What do you suggest I do with the payments I will be receiving? I haven't set up direct deposit so I will be receiving these cheques soon. Given that I am eligible for both, should I just hold on to them for now and wait for my immigration date to be fixed (as well as send the GST/HST Credit Application for Individuals Who Become Residents of Canada form?) What will happen once the immigration date is corrected and the system finds that I shouldn't have received these payments as I didn't fill out that form?

230,"Hey Everyone, 

I am Abhiraj Lamba and I am running to be a WUSA Math Councillor. I took part in both AMAs yesterday and tried to answer as many questions as possible to the best of my abilities. Since I am currently in a different time zones, I did miss out on answering a few questions and I am sorry about that.

Just wanted to give y'all an overview of my platform :-

1. Increased Mental Health Advocacy - It is no secret that as university students, we are all under constant pressure and stress. It is extremely important for students to take care of their mental health. I currently sit on the university’s Committee on Student Mental Health as the international students’ representative and we have been working on implementing 36 recommendations from a previous committee called PAC-SMH. Currently 75% of these recommendations are complete and the rest are in progress. These recommendations include points like equipping AcessAbility Services and opening a continuous dialogue within campus, for example. Once the mandate of the committee ends in April, WUSA will be one of the many organisations responsible for seeing all the completed recommendations through. As a WUSA Councillor, I will be able to actively play a part in ensuring that all these recommendations continue serving their intended purposes.

For more information regarding CoSMH recommendations: [https://uwaterloo.ca/mental-health-wellness/progress-dashboard](https://uwaterloo.ca/mental-health-wellness/progress-dashboard)  


2. Safer and More Inclusive Campus for ALL Students - The health and safety of all students must be a priority. This means not only do we have to hold the university accountable for how the students feel. We must also compel the university to hold students accountable for their actions which go against this ethos.  


3. Being YOUR Voice - As my campaign slogan (""Here To Hear You"") makes it clear, the most important thing for me is to be your voice. This means that I promise to personally make an effort to understand what my constituents (you) want and need, and raise my voice with their case. I promise to be YOUR representative in every sense of the word! I have pledged to host a weekly office hour, if elected, open to all undergraduate math students, so that they can share their concerns with me. I will have a 24 hour email policy, i.e. any email I receive will be responded to within 24 hours. I would push for a mailing list access to be given so that particular agenda points can be discussed with students.

However, most of these issues would not be enough to engage and communicate with Students. To combat this, I will be pushing for a Math caucus public town hall twice a term. That is, if elected, I would be discussing and working on implementing with my fellow Math Councillors, a Town Hall for Math Students to attend and bring forward their concerns to their representatives. (If this implementation goes well, we can get other caucuses to follow suit)

So do vote for me in the elections tomorrow.

So the problem is, that I want to transfer from econ BA to psyc BA. I already applied to transfer at the begging of fall, got conditionally accepted even though it was my first term (prob bc my HS gpa was 4.0), but bc of my gpa in fall, got rejected. So the question is if I recover my gpa to 3.1 (which is a cutoff), would I still have chances of getting in? Is it harder for internal students? Is my first rejection going to influence their decision? And is the fact of me retaking some classes would look bad? Btw, I’m an international student, if that matters.

238,"I posted this on Piazza but thought I might as well post it here for those of u who arent in the class wondering what its like, and those who dont check piazza:

I am writing this as many people I’ve talked to can relate to a lot of people voicing concerns on Piazza, but felt that some people didn’t expand on their points very eloquently (no offense!) and I would just like to share mine and some peers’ general thoughts on the 137 course so far. Also sorry if my wording-word choice is not great, I am not good at forming out my thoughts in words.
This year is especially hard given we have online learning, which just doesn’t work very well for some people (like me) for various reasons such as understanding things clearly written out (maybe not this type of learner), having ADHD or learning disabilities that make things extra hard, having to work in unideal environments, etc. It is also an unprecedented time and the things that can be done by universities are limited and hard for them to determine the best course of action so I do get this aspect of why people are finding the course hard. However, I do have some concerns/personal feedback on this course.

Even people in upper years now admit that the assessments we are doing this year in 137 are a lot harder than they had (ex. on reddit). There is also an instructor who agrees this year is much harder “I took this course myself years ago and found it challenging to adapt from highschool, so I can't even imagine how much harder this is” https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/jkjeeq/math_137/ A large part of this must be the online learning, but I think that there are a few aspects of the course that are really just making it harder for us than necessary. 

I have heard profs say that this year’s marks for the class are in line with past years. I think that the marks are still in line with past years because a good chunk of people are just doing well because of all the opportunities to cheat in a plethora of ways even if it's just slightly cheating, with assessments being online and unsupervised after all. The instructors must've known this and hence increased the difficulty level of quizzes etc. However, this leaves a number of those who wouldn't want to cheat but are unable to keep up with the difficulty of this course or have difficulty learning in an online format, to see low marks. (Or people who just cannot pass without cheating general). This may actually lead to eventual desperation and cheating, making a big loop back to the beginning issue of cheating (where instructors don’t want this year’s grades to all be super high for unfair reasons). While I understand that most classes in any university like to see this nice bell curve and would like scores in each year to be relatively similar, in the end it is unfair to individual students to have to up the difficulty especially given how hard it is for some people to learn at all on an online format. Now this also causes a lot of anxiety, stress, lack of sleep, and overall strain on mental health especially with the already heavy stress of quarantine for some individuals. 

Talking about specifics, I would like to address the following areas that I take issue with. One thing is the very particular wording on mobius quizzes that needs you to read super thoroughly. This makes it very easy to have silly mistakes made by those who actually understand the material but didn’t read closely enough or have many distractions and couldn’t focus on the wording so much. The wording could be especially confusing to international students who already have a hard time understanding different meanings in English and they seem to have a clear unfair disadvantage. Another thing is how we don’t get any part marks and thus need to know every question extremely well which is even worse coupled with sometimes weird wording. I get that this is a hard one to move around, but for courses such as 135 I feel like it has managed to implement part marks very well (also side note, the fact that we don’t know the number of right answers, as ALL of the questions ask you to choose unlimited choices, adds an additional layer of difficulty). During office hours with a prof, he didn’t even know what the some of the questions were asking and was very confused. I think this fact really reflects the issues with the wording as even a prof couldn’t understand it well. A third thing is how we don’t get to know the correct answers on the mobius which doesn’t help us improve for next time and we have to wait for afterwards when we can check the markbook. But by that time, we would have moved onto concepts taught 2 weeks later, and we could lack the fundamental knowledge from earlier which causes a domino effect of struggling to understand. On a smaller scale, sometimes mobius messes up and marks things incorrectly so not seeing the correct answer causes more confusion and self doubt. Another thing is the fact that a lot of the questions are not explained in videos and we need to make all connections ourselves. Much of the content being actually taught is just the theorems, but how to critically solve questions and what to make of the content is completely up to our own understanding. Also the videos are from several years ago which can be perceived by some as lacking care. 

In response to the idea some people are suggesting about increased attempts on mobius, ex. 5 attempts from now on: I myself did see a mark improvement with the 5 attempts, but I don’t think my actual understanding of information changed much, I just learned what not to choose next time. So, I don’t believe making 5 attempts is a great idea no matter how much I personally would like this, because it doesn’t address the real issue of how many students are struggling to understand the content with the current teaching methods/course structure. I also disagree with people who want to change the overall weighting of the 2 parts of the midterm. I think this would be very unfair as the weights have been set at the beginning of the year and some people actually did well on sections the majority did not. If anything, the difficulty of *future* things could be decreased or we could be given more bonus assignment, etc (I will not speak on my suggestions as the profs know more about what is realistic or actually possible to implement). 

Another thing I won’t address too much as to not spread any rumours based on speculation, is the 225% overacceptance. My personal belief is that the difficulty has also been upped in order to trim down this number, and historically it does make sense. A 225% overaccepted math faculty occurred as they expected many people to defer their acceptance due to covid concerns, but made a big error leading to the overacceptance rate. I cannot speak on any of the 14x courses, but I think that my hypothesis isn’t really applicable for those courses in the first place as those who are less strong with math would choose 13x courses opposed to those who have done the Euclid and proved that they can handle 14x, and by extension, “deserve to at UW”. So 13x courses would be an obvious course to try to use to slim down the population. For example, this course is hard, CS135 is a lot of work, and even 135 started getting a lot harder perhaps because we were all doing really well at the beginning (seen on the mark distributions). This overacceptance rate is certainly frustrating for everyone and must be a very hard issue to deal with for the school, but it is equally frustrating to be given much greater expectations than previous years because of the need to thin down the population. I get this is how universities operate but it is unfair nonetheless that we didn’t contribute to the overacceptance and especially for those who won’t “make the cut” and have to deal with the extra disappointment of failing their requirements (I, for one, would certainly rather not be accepted than come only to waste my time and effort then fail). Again, not saying this is the truth in any way, just my opinion of this year’s difficulty level.

Addressing the midterm specifically because I didn’t see as many people voicing concerns until the midterm: This part is only going to be my personal opinion. I think the mobius parts had the same level of difficulty as normal quizzes, but all mobius quizzes are flawed in my opinion, and the midterm simply really reflected this unfairness. The crowdmark part was certainly harder for me, because of how we didn’t do anything too similar to it before, and it was harder than the crowdmark questions for the past few weeks. Just from my own performance on it.

Finally, I want to say that I do understand this is a very unique time and determining the right way to do anything is extremely difficult especially for profs, I am in no way trying to complain or blame anyone, however I do think this is a struggle for many students that I would like to bring to light with a more thorough explanation. I know that the profs are trying their best in this hard time, and they do care about us. I want to say a big thank you to all the instructors who have to deal with figuring everything out and also monitoring piazza so closely (it’s really awesome, I got a reply at 3am yesterday) and I really appreciate this. Also, there are undoubtedly students who are just able to get very good marks in this course (I will not pretend like everyone is struggling) and I am in no way trying to minimize your effort, good job for those who are doing well! 

Please stay strong and hopeful everyone, I believe in you! And a gentle reminder to please be nice to your fellow students on piazza, we are all trying our best!",1.0
239,"I'm really starting to wonder if health services are just trash or if the doctor that I always end up dealing with is trash? Has anyone else had bad experiences where they give you a hard time transferring scripts when you're an international student? Not being given proper treatment/ having the problem downplayed? Asking for referrals because your having health issues and being told that a completely unrelated doctor that you're also getting a referral to will handle it?

Been a student for 3 years and had to go 4 months without my meds when I first got here because they had to discuss my meds with my doctor from home because they thought I shouldn't be on Concerta because they thought my diagnosis of ADHD was fake so that I could get the meds just to boost my studying. Got a severe concussion that I was told was minor and to rest for a couple of days and that I would be fine after a month, after 5 months and when I was finally able to go home and see my doctor I was diagnosed with post-concussive depression and severe memory problems which I suspected and during that 5 months at school, I had to argue with the school just to get a referral to get an MRI (over a month after it happened) which turns out for a concussion should be done within the first week otherwise it won't show anything and then they stopped me from getting the results for over a month. Then when I ask for a few referrals (3) they only send me (2) and tell me that the allergist referral will handle my gastrointestinal problems (even though I need to get an endoscopy to confirm if I am celiac and the doctor told me that my blood test for it came back positive so I already have it, WHICH ISNT TRUE, it means you have the genetics for it but that it can only be confirmed through an endoscopy) and so they won't give me a referral for a GI doctor because supposedly and allergist can handle any possible gut issues I have (they can guess, but they will still end up telling me to see a GI doctor). 

So basically, I have never once had a good experience with Concordia's health services, have always been given extremely rushed care (visits are 10 minutes or less and the nurses you see prior are more helpful than the stupid doctor I always end up with), half the time the doctor just asks me ""what do I think is wrong with me"" and then says ok diagnoses me with that problem and then gives me referrals/prescriptions for the WRONG THING. If you are able to go to a CLSC and can afford to pay and wait to be reimbursed do that because Concordia's health services will be absolutely no help to you!",1.0

242,"Oh man where do i even start. I kid you not this year has been nothing but a series of unfortunate events. The year started off with me losing my ENTIRE friends circle just like that but that was okay because i was in a relationship with a very sweet girl and bam i lose her as well shortly after. Had internships lined for the summer. Poof. Lost them just like that as well. I got laid off from my part time job due to corona, which was the only source of income I had to support myself since I am not one of those rich international students. I am in the hardest Engineering Stream and second year for us was just absolutely brutal with so many shitty profs. Even during this pandemic they were fucking us over. Usually i dont mind the grind because I know come summer i can relax and go out and do stuff but now that winter term has ended I have nothing to do here in Hamilton.

I am an international student so i live by myself near Mac. I can't even go back to my home country and see my parents because shits getting real bad back there. Oh and i just found out that my mom was hospitalised. I really hope its not corona.

People say go watch netflix or play video games but honestly I don't enjoy doing those stuff. I thrive when I am out with people and friends hanging out and enjoying life. I could pick up a new technical skill but honestly Its also so hard to get on the grind and learn a new skill right after doing such an intense exam season during this whole pandemic. I am just not mentally that strong yet.

It's so sad i stare at my phone screen all day hoping to see a message or a notification from anyone but its just endless void. Its so weird how i literally lost every single thing i worked for within the span of a few months. 

I was suffering from depression for so many years and back home i was never supported for it. But honestly ever since coming to Mac the people here have been nothing but loving and supportive towards me. I was finally, for the first time,happy and really thought i found my place. But i think my depression is slowly creeping in. I had friends, a loving SO, a super supportive community, an encouraging manager at work, internship lined up, travel plans for the summer. Now that it is all gone, I am feeling soo lost.

246,"I’m pretty sure mental health in general suffered a steep decline.

Not that it was ever great for students given how terrible post-secondary education is. Last I checked (around 2014-2015 when I was in college), mental health problems were already increasing on campuses across NA exponentially, even as the economy was picking up.

I think students are vulnerable to mental health problems due to a lot of factors that don’t really apply to, say, a person in a white collar job during the lockdown.

Like higher economic & career insecurity, less wealth, fewer familial ties, international students living on the other side of the world from where they grew up or where their families are, no coworkers scheduling daily meetings (which inadvertently keep people from procrastinating too long), fewer opportunities to collaborate without fear of plagiarism, a need to work multiple jobs to stay afloat, less life experience, high-stress deadlines from multiple profs who don’t talk to each other and generally don’t consider the students workload from other classes the way a manager would, etc.

252,"Vacancy rates in Canada’s two biggest housing markets are rising, rents are falling and luxury homes are struggling to be sold.

Christine Zhu, a Toronto-based realtor, has not facilitated a single purchase or sale on homes since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her clientele are almost exclusively Chinese nationals whose kids are either already international students in Canadian universities and high schools in Ontario, or are looking to begin school this fall.

In a regular spring market, she would have processed at least eight sales every month, mostly condominium units that Chinese parents would purchase for their children, in addition to numerous rentals. This season she’s spending her days on the phone with landlords, negotiating on behalf of students who have gone back to China, and have no idea when they will return, leaving their leased apartments vacant. 

There are approximately 640,000 international students in Canada — over 50 per cent of them are Chinese and Indian nationals who make up a significant part of the rental market in Canada’s largest cities. In a typical summer season, tens of thousands of new foreign students, landed immigrants and non-permanent residents looking for work arrive in Canada, seeking some kind of housing, either to rent or buy.

But with international travel frozen, multiple realtors and housing experts the Financial Post spoke to over the course of the week say that the lack of the usual immigration and travel pattern is starting to have a noticeable impact on the housing markets of Toronto and Vancouver. In particular, vacancy rates are rising in downtown rental markets, pushing prices lower, while luxury homes that usually attract rich foreign investors are struggling to be sold leading to price drops or, in some cases, court-ordered sales. 

In April, the numbers of permanent residents admitted to Canada declined by 80 per cent from the year prior — just 4,140 were processed and admitted compared to 26,900 in April 2019, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

Also sorry if my wording-word choice is not great, I am not good at forming out my thoughts in words.
This year is especially hard given we have online learning, which just doesn’t work very well for some people (like me) for various reasons such as understanding things clearly written out (maybe not this type of learner), having ADHD or learning disabilities that make things extra hard, having to work in unideal environments, etc. It is also an unprecedented time and the things that can be done by universities are limited and hard for them to determine the best course of action so I do get this aspect of why people are finding the course hard. However, I do have some concerns/personal feedback on this course.

Even people in upper years now admit that the assessments we are doing this year in 137 are a lot harder than they had (ex. on reddit). There is also an instructor who agrees this year is much harder “I took this course myself years ago and found it challenging to adapt from highschool, so I can't even imagine how much harder this is” https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/jkjeeq/math_137/ A large part of this must be the online learning, but I think that there are a few aspects of the course that are really just making it harder for us than necessary. 

I have heard profs say that this year’s marks for the class are in line with past years. I think that the marks are still in line with past years because a good chunk of people are just doing well because of all the opportunities to cheat in a plethora of ways even if it's just slightly cheating, with assessments being online and unsupervised after all. The instructors must've known this and hence increased the difficulty level of quizzes etc. However, this leaves a number of those who wouldn't want to cheat but are unable to keep up with the difficulty of this course or have difficulty learning in an online format, to see low marks. (Or people who just cannot pass without cheating general). This may actually lead to eventual desperation and cheating, making a big loop back to the beginning issue of cheating (where instructors don’t want this year’s grades to all be super high for unfair reasons). While I understand that most classes in any university like to see this nice bell curve and would like scores in each year to be relatively similar, in the end it is unfair to individual students to have to up the difficulty especially given how hard it is for some people to learn at all on an online format. Now this also causes a lot of anxiety, stress, lack of sleep, and overall strain on mental health especially with the already heavy stress of quarantine for some individuals. 

Talking about specifics, I would like to address the following areas that I take issue with. One thing is the very particular wording on mobius quizzes that needs you to read super thoroughly. This makes it very easy to have silly mistakes made by those who actually understand the material but didn’t read closely enough or have many distractions and couldn’t focus on the wording so much. The wording could be especially confusing to international students who already have a hard time understanding different meanings in English and they seem to have a clear unfair disadvantage. Another thing is how we don’t get any part marks and thus need to know every question extremely well which is even worse coupled with sometimes weird wording. I get that this is a hard one to move around, but for courses such as 135 I feel like it has managed to implement part marks very well (also side note, the fact that we don’t know the number of right answers, as ALL of the questions ask you to choose unlimited choices, adds an additional layer of difficulty). During office hours with a prof, he didn’t even know what the some of the questions were asking and was very confused. I think this fact really reflects the issues with the wording as even a prof couldn’t understand it well. A third thing is how we don’t get to know the correct answers on the mobius which doesn’t help us improve for next time and we have to wait for afterwards when we can check the markbook. But by that time, we would have moved onto concepts taught 2 weeks later, and we could lack the fundamental knowledge from earlier which causes a domino effect of struggling to understand. On a smaller scale, sometimes mobius messes up and marks things incorrectly so not seeing the correct answer causes more confusion and self doubt. Another thing is the fact that a lot of the questions are not explained in videos and we need to make all connections ourselves. Much of the content being actually taught is just the theorems, but how to critically solve questions and what to make of the content is completely up to our own understanding. Also the videos are from several years ago which can be perceived by some as lacking care. 

In response to the idea some people are suggesting about increased attempts on mobius, ex. 5 attempts from now on: I myself did see a mark improvement with the 5 attempts, but I don’t think my actual understanding of information changed much, I just learned what not to choose next time. So, I don’t believe making 5 attempts is a great idea no matter how much I personally would like this, because it doesn’t address the real issue of how many students are struggling to understand the content with the current teaching methods/course structure. I also disagree with people who want to change the overall weighting of the 2 parts of the midterm. I think this would be very unfair as the weights have been set at the beginning of the year and some people actually did well on sections the majority did not. If anything, the difficulty of *future* things could be decreased or we could be given more bonus assignment, etc (I will not speak on my suggestions as the profs know more about what is realistic or actually possible to implement). 

Another thing I won’t address too much as to not spread any rumours based on speculation, is the 225% overacceptance. My personal belief is that the difficulty has also been upped in order to trim down this number, and historically it does make sense. A 225% overaccepted math faculty occurred as they expected many people to defer their acceptance due to covid concerns, but made a big error leading to the overacceptance rate. I cannot speak on any of the 14x courses, but I think that my hypothesis isn’t really applicable for those courses in the first place as those who are less strong with math would choose 13x courses opposed to those who have done the Euclid and proved that they can handle 14x, and by extension, “deserve to at UW”. So 13x courses would be an obvious course to try to use to slim down the population. For example, this course is hard, CS135 is a lot of work, and even 135 started getting a lot harder perhaps because we were all doing really well at the beginning (seen on the mark distributions). This overacceptance rate is certainly frustrating for everyone and must be a very hard issue to deal with for the school, but it is equally frustrating to be given much greater expectations than previous years because of the need to thin down the population. I get this is how universities operate but it is unfair nonetheless that we didn’t contribute to the overacceptance and especially for those who won’t “make the cut” and have to deal with the extra disappointment of failing their requirements (I, for one, would certainly rather not be accepted than come only to waste my time and effort then fail). Again, not saying this is the truth in any way, just my opinion of this year’s difficulty level.

Addressing the midterm specifically because I didn’t see as many people voicing concerns until the midterm: This part is only going to be my personal opinion. I think the mobius parts had the same level of difficulty as normal quizzes, but all mobius quizzes are flawed in my opinion, and the midterm simply really reflected this unfairness. The crowdmark part was certainly harder for me, because of how we didn’t do anything too similar to it before, and it was harder than the crowdmark questions for the past few weeks. Just from my own performance on it.

Finally, I want to say that I do understand this is a very unique time and determining the right way to do anything is extremely difficult especially for profs, I am in no way trying to complain or blame anyone, however I do think this is a struggle for many students that I would like to bring to light with a more thorough explanation. I know that the profs are trying their best in this hard time, and they do care about us. I want to say a big thank you to all the instructors who have to deal with figuring everything out and also monitoring piazza so closely (it’s really awesome, I got a reply at 3am yesterday) and I really appreciate this. Also, there are undoubtedly students who are just able to get very good marks in this course (I will not pretend like everyone is struggling) and I am in no way trying to minimize your effort, good job for those who are doing well! 

Please stay strong and hopeful everyone, I believe in you! And a gentle reminder to please be nice to your fellow students on piazza, we are all trying our best!",1.0

Also if an international student does live outside Canada for a few months while the course technically is still in session (all our classes have moved online), can this affect eligibility for PGWP?

However, there might be several different categories of vaccines available in different countries, and based on an article published on PubMed, there're possibilities that different vaccines may undermine the effects of each other if administered together. So far no evidence has shown whether different vaccines will interact with each other, so I wonder if the university will determine what vaccines are acceptable for immunocompromised students so they won't have to be re-vaccinated, which is uncertain if it's a right thing to do.",1.0

I was an international student in the United States in California. I graduated with a Business degree from the US university and now doing OPT that expires next January. My company won't be able to sponsor me and now I'm considering Canada as a potential option for a move.

Had any non-US citizen with the US diploma was able to move to Canada for work? Does anyone knows who've done it successfully straight from the US? Or how tough/easy is it? Not sure how true is it, but from researching I found that it's easier to obtain the working visa and residency in Canada than in the United States, which is why I'm also considering it. Want to do this before my time in U.S. expires as I don't want to come back to my home country.

What would you suggest, do research on jobs and start asking the companies if they can get a working visa for someone like me? Or should I do the Express Entry thing? And how often does the express entry do their draws?  Would it be better to do the Express Entry or through the work permit?

I feel like this move could be a great option to consider as most likely I can be a great candidate with lots to offer and won't have a problem with adjusting to culture.

I've lived in the US for 11 years so I have a perfect English and will have 2-2.5 years of experience total upon my OPT completion in the United States.

#Closure Related FAQs

Classes are moving online. HOWEVER, specific circumstances for labs, midterms, finals, or anything that doesn’t easily translate online MAY be held in person.

##DO NOT LEAVE VANCOUVER UNTIL *ALL* OF YOUR PROFS CONFIRM THAT IT IS OK TO DO SO.

Please also know that the government is considering a travel ban which may make it impossible to return to Vancouver for an indefinite amount of time. In addition, there are all the risks of travelling at this time, in terms of both getting infected and unknowingly transmitting to others.

We understand that international students are facing very difficult decisions right now, and they should know that the university is working very hard to get answers to their concerns quickly!

&gt; UBC is transitioning to online classes effective Monday March 16, 2020 for the remainder of the term. For classes that cannot be accommodated online, we will be issuing further information through our Faculties.  This will apply to UBC Vancouver, UBC Okanagan and UBC Robson Square.

.

&gt; UBC’s campuses will remain open and all university operations will continue as normal, as we transition.

#Some General COVID-19 FAQs

**What should I do if I think I have COVID-19?**

&gt; Anyone concerned that they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of the novel coronavirus, should contact their primary care provider, local public health office, or call 8-1-1

**Symptoms:**

&gt; * cough, sneezing, fever, sore throat and difficulty breathing
&gt; * [Symptoms compared with those of colds and the flu](https://preview.redd.it/kbtb3qeyenl41.jpg?width=769&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dff319f72f78eaa04c0d353ee98b0a0443236700)

**How is it spread**

&gt; * Larger liquid droplets when a person coughs or sneezes transmitted via larger liquid droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. The virus can enter through these droplets through the eyes, nose or throat if you are in close contact. The virus is not known to be airborne (e.g. transmitted through the particles floating in the air) and it is not something that comes in through the skin.
&gt; * Close contact is defined as [...] being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time
&gt; * It can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they cough. That’s why we recommend you cough or sneeze into your arm and wash your hands regularly.
&gt; * It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

**What can I do to prevent catching it?**

&gt; * Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds using soap and water. If a sink is not available, 60-90% alcohol-based hand rubs (hand sanitizer) can be used to clean hands if they are not visibly soiled. If they are visibly soiled, you can use an alcohol-based disposable hand wipe to remove the dirt and then use an alcohol-based hand rub.
&gt; * Do not touch your eyes/nose/mouth with unwashed hands.
&gt; * When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a disposable tissue or the crease of your elbow, and then wash your hands.
&gt; * Stay home when you are ill to avoid spreading the illness to others.
&gt; * Avoid close contact with people who are sick with an infection.
&gt; * Stay healthy: Stay healthy by eating healthy foods, keeping physically active, getting enough sleep.

294,"Hello, my fellow international students. I am not sure if most of you are aware but under the current border restrictions, we will not be allowed to return to Canada if all of your courses are online for the Fall term. After looking at the vague rules on the Canadianaccess immigration website and consulting with a university immigration consultant, I can share that from what I researched, if your only reason for coming back to Canada will be your online courses then you will be denied acces.   
I had planned a trip to go back home this week but luckily enough I realized this could happen and I will be holding my trip until more information comes out about this.   
If you are concerned as much as I am about this send a concerned email to the HREI office and the President's office so they start giving us more information about the problem. Up to this point, the university has made 0 statements about this and continue to offer residences for incoming first-year international students 

As most of you saw the US implemented a terrible immigration policy last week. I hate to say it but a similar immigration law is being implemented at the moment in Canada and no one is speaking about it",1.0

297,"To everyone panicking about COVID: yes, US universities are shutting down. But Canada and the US aren’t even remotely in the same situation right now. The US is panicking because they have done so few tests so far, they have NO IDEA who has COVID and no way of limiting or even tracking community spread. They don’t even have the resources to test everyone who has come back from China/Italy/SK these past two months, let alone the people in contact with them. There could be 100 cases in New York, or 10,000, and the medical system is too overwhelmed to even accommodate a fraction of these cases.

On the other hand, BC has been prepared since day one, and has tested more people for coronavirus than the ENTIRE US has as of last week (1). Sure, we share a border with the US, and there’s obviously going to be community spread, but BC has the resources to track down people from high risk areas and isolate them, in a way that eg Italy can’t. The trail and origin of each case has been much much more well documented than it has in severely impacted nations (2). 

All this said, it doesn’t remotely make sense for UBC to shut down the campus. They should probably be doing more to promote social distancing — offering more lecturecasts, limiting gatherings officially, maybe offering online exams — but they are by no means “irresponsible” for refusing to shut down the school at a point when there are fewer than 50 cases in the entire province, and when many experts are convinced that the situation is under control in Canada (3).

I think the misinformation has gone way too far, at this point. There are many reasons why the US is shutting down schools. The situation in UBC doesn’t meet most of those criteria, and the consequences from a shutdown — hundreds people in the area losing jobs they can’t afford to lose, international students with nowhere to go, students unable to graduate or fulfill requirements — far outpace the benefits.

##Some General FAQs

**What should I do if I think I have COVID-19?**

&gt; Anyone concerned that they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of the novel coronavirus, should contact their primary care provider, local public health office, or call 8-1-1

**Symptoms:**

&gt; * cough, sneezing, fever, sore throat and difficulty breathing
* link with comparisons for symptoms

**How is it spread**

&gt; * Larger liquid droplets when a person coughs or sneezes transmitted via larger liquid droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. The virus can enter through these droplets through the eyes, nose or throat if you are in close contact. The virus is not known to be airborne (e.g. transmitted through the particles floating in the air) and it is not something that comes in through the skin.
&gt; * Close contact is defined as [...] being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time
&gt; * It can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they cough. That’s why we recommend you cough or sneeze into your arm and wash your hands regularly.
&gt; * It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.


**What can I do to prevent from catching it?** 

&gt; * Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds using soap and water. If a sink is not available, 60-90% alcohol-based hand rubs (hand sanitizer) can be used to clean hands if they are not visibly soiled. If they are visibly soiled, you can use an alcohol-based disposable hand wipe to remove the dirt and then use an alcohol-based hand rub.
&gt; * Do not touch your eyes/nose/mouth with unwashed hands.
&gt; * When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a disposable tissue or the crease of your elbow, and then wash your hands.
&gt; * Stay home when you are ill to avoid spreading the illness to others.
&gt; * Avoid close contact with people who are sick with an infection.
&gt; * Stay healthy: Stay healthy by eating healthy foods, keeping physically active, getting enough sleep.


##Some UBC Specific FAQs

**Will the university be closed for COVID-19?**
&gt; * There is no information yet and no one can really know for sure until there is. Once information is released, this section will be updated with it. Till that point, feel free to check the many discussion threads about this, or discuss in the comments below.

**How will the residences be affected?**
&gt; * If a student resides in a Student Housing &amp; Community Services (SHCS) residence with roommates where self-isolation may not be feasible, they should contact SHCS to inquire if an alternate option may be available at information@housing.ubc.ca

**How high is the risk of contracting the coronavirus disease, COVID-19 in BC?**

&gt; At this time, the BC Centre for Disease Control advises that the risk to British Columbians continues to be low.

**What is UBC doing to minimise the risk of infection to students, faculty and staff?**

&gt; * UBC has senior level committees working to develop plans and responses to the evolving situation.
&gt; * We have increased the distribution of hand sanitizers around campus and posted information to remind people of how to reduce the spread of infections.
&gt; * UBC consults with the BC Centre for Disease Control and Vancouver Coastal Health on how to detect and mitigate any potential cases on our campuses. We have appropriate measures and equipment in place, in the event that we are presented with someone displaying COVID-19 symptoms.

**Are any UBC students, faculty or staff reported to be confirmed cases?**

&gt; * We are currently not aware of any cases amongst our students, faculty and staff, both within BC or abroad. In the event of a confirmed case, information would be provided to the public by the relevant health agency, according to their protocols.


**Will there be any academic concessions for students who are supposed to travel to COVID-19 affected areas as part of their studies and whose programs abroad are cancelled?**

&gt; * If any programs are cancelled, UBC will work with students on a case-by-case basis to determine how best to support them

Since Canada doesn't approve the Sinopharm vaccine which I already took, I'm considering taking two doses of the Pfizer in order to be able to go around the quarantine.

352,"It's great that the majority of Canadians have taken their first dose of vaccine. However, it's important to keep in mind that U of T is located at the heart of downtown Toronto with many international students and commuters attending this university.

Yes, my body's immune system might be able to protect me from COVID (after taking the vaccine, hopefully...), but it doesn't stop me from spreading it to my more ""fragile"" grandparents at home. As a commuter, I'm basically guaranteed to carry COVID back home as I have to take the public transit. 

All I ask is for a ""transition period"" as originally proposed by U of T for the Winter 2021 session but with in-person exams and hybrid style lectures. This is a win-win for everyone, for the university (Gertler loves money), for the people wanting to attend lectures in-person, and for the people wanting to stay at home.

I should also remind you all that a couple notable profs here at U of T died because of COVID. (e.g. Prof Alfonso)

354,"According to this policy, ICE requires international students to either leave the country or find a different university that is allowing in-person classes. I think this policy as of now is very stupid and in a way evil? Its almost like they are trying to force unis to stay open during a raging pandemic or be in deep financial doom. Not to mention the prospective international students won’t be able to make the trip to states with border closures. Some may even have signed their lease for the next year. I really empathize with those students who will be left in a limbo due to this policy. Now this policy maybe blocked in the courts but as of rn this is the protocol in place.  

Hearing this makes me feel even more grateful to have chosen Canada for post sec over the states. I love this country. It feels more like home away from
home. I’ve met great people here and made some life lasting friendships that I’ll always cherish. This is part of the reason why I’ve never went home ever since I’ve been here. Canada by no means is perfect and ofc have problems to be addressed and we should always strive to be better but the response by the Government here to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 when you compare to the states is a God send. We can all roast this uni and what not but UofA has turned out to be a part of my identity. Love walking around campus (maybe not as much during winters) and meeting new people.

355,"The values of the current Liberal government (tax and spend, print money, super high deficits even before pandemic) seem to be complete opposite of the fiscally conservative values most people on this board value.

Also, Liberals have really raised immigration rates and increases international student intake. This ultimately creates too much demand for housing, causing home prices to rise. Yet so many people here seem to want to get into the market, but are having trouble doing so because of high prices. 

Do the people here who vote Liberal ever think that a lot of these problems are self-inflicted because of who they voted for?

i’ve thought about buses and trains but nothing is going across the border at this moment, so it seems my only option is a train or bus then a taxi then i’d have to walk across the border (doable, but will be costly with all the extra steps). i’ve called most of the US customs at the ON/NY and QC/NY borders and most are discouraging walking across the border for various reasons.

379,"Hi, 

I’m currently an international student in the US on a student visa working toward my PhD in a STEM field. I’ve just entered my 4th year and will be graduating by mid 2022. I would like to immigrate to Canada upon my graduation through the Express Entry program but I’m still unclear about some of the steps, in particular the timing of them. 

My current CRS score with my Master’s Degree is 481. if I understand the Express Entry Draw method currently, I believe that means if I were to submit my application today, I’d probably receive my ITA in the next draw. The issue is, I’d like to finish my PhD studies before moving to Canada permanently, but I’d also like to apply for my PR as soon as possible and have my PR before I graduate. I was wondering, are there any legal obstacles that forbids me from applying for the Canadian PR through the Express Entry program 1.5-2 years before I intend to move and settle in Canada? The reason I’d like to apply before I graduate is because by the time I graduate, I’ll be over 30 years of age and I’m going to lose some points in CRS. I’m also not sure if the Express Entry system is going to be the same in 2 years.

Been a student for 3 years and had to go 4 months without my meds when I first got here because they had to discuss my meds with my doctor from home because they thought I shouldn't be on Concerta because they thought my diagnosis of ADHD was fake so that I could get the meds just to boost my studying. Got a severe concussion that I was told was minor and to rest for a couple of days and that I would be fine after a month, after 5 months and when I was finally able to go home and see my doctor I was diagnosed with post-concussive depression and severe memory problems which I suspected and during that 5 months at school, I had to argue with the school just to get a referral to get an MRI (over a month after it happened) which turns out for a concussion should be done within the first week otherwise it won't show anything and then they stopped me from getting the results for over a month. Then when I ask for a few referrals (3) they only send me (2) and tell me that the allergist referral will handle my gastrointestinal problems (even though I need to get an endoscopy to confirm if I am celiac and the doctor told me that my blood test for it came back positive so I already have it, WHICH ISNT TRUE, it means you have the genetics for it but that it can only be confirmed through an endoscopy) and so they won't give me a referral for a GI doctor because supposedly and allergist can handle any possible gut issues I have (they can guess, but they will still end up telling me to see a GI doctor). 

So basically, I have never once had a good experience with Concordia's health services, have always been given extremely rushed care (visits are 10 minutes or less and the nurses you see prior are more helpful than the stupid doctor I always end up with), half the time the doctor just asks me ""what do I think is wrong with me"" and then says ok diagnoses me with that problem and then gives me referrals/prescriptions for the WRONG THING. If you are able to go to a CLSC and can afford to pay and wait to be reimbursed do that because Concordia's health services will be absolutely no help to you!",1.0

431,"I think one thing needs to be cleared up and understood by everyone.

There is no difference between the Chinese people, and the Chinese government.

Let me explain why this is obviously true.

The arguments to the contrary are that ""the Chinese people cannot control the government or stop them from doing anything"".

But what do the Chinese do here? Whether they're international students or Canadian-born, do their actions and words exemplify people who do not prop up dictatorial leadership?

What are their arguments lately? ""Canada is a diverse country, zero tolerance for racism, he should be fired"". 

So let's unpack this. What does it really say? The government (and UW) advertised to these people abroad that this is a ""diverse, multicultural"" place that does not ""tolerate"" racism. That is, *the authorities* told them how people here are.

But it turns out, people aren't like that. So what do they do? They use that very same authority to shut those people down, they align themselves with the authority against the individual. Even though they themselves spout far worse things to that individual than he ever said about them.

When they find out you aren't following the authorities, this is when they degrade and insult you the most. You're uneducated, you're an incel, you're mentally ill, you're a pig with no job, you must be inbred etc. etc.

This is the current state of the Chinese. They are an authority-worshipping hivemind, and they are trying to force this manner of thinking on us. 

For nearly 300 years, until 1912, these people were enslaved by the Manchus. They were forced into total obedience under threat of execution. Now that they rule themselves, they're barely different - they work themselves to death and virulently enforce whatever the authorities want. They bring this slave mentality to us here.

The Chinese government, and the Chinese people, are one in the same. I'm sure you know one or two nice ones. I do too. That doesn't negate the fact that they pose an immense existential threat to any concept of personal liberties in this country.

UW looks the other way on these problems. They know these people cheat on everything, I've seen them forgive things that should have resulted in immediate expulsion. They know China is an extremely unethical country, they know the CCP is a authoritarian regime that has minorities in concentration camps. But they continue to take in the children of CCP officials as students. They take their dirty blood money, their sweat shop slave money.

I'm done with UW. With the admin, and the students. If this crisis wasn't enough to make you see what's going on, you'll never see it and I want nothing to do with you.

For any of you who want to cry about racism and oppression right now, take a look in the fucking mirror. Your school supports the CCP. Period. It educates their children, it ignores their academic offenses, it protects them from ""racist"" jokes when they're members of a group that are oppressing millions of people right now. It's all a fucking sham and I'm done pretending like this place has a ounce of integrity.

I'm not replying to any further comments. If you're Chinese, go home. If you're white and think I'm wrong, your grandkids will speak Mandarin. If you're something else, also go home. Bye.",0.0
432,"First off, miss me with your antivaxx and “ma freedom” stuff. I don’t want to hear it, because I have been hearing it for my whole life. Your arguments are moot to me.

The university should take every precaution to ensure the return to in person classes goes as smoothly as possible. This should include ensuring all students who will be on campus are vaccinated to reduce the possible spread of Covid. The last thing you want for in person classes is an outbreak, no matter how big or small.

Logistically, it would be a cascade of issues for students who become ill/need to isolate. Just completely avoid this problem in the first place. The last thing we all want is the possible return back to online because of issues like this.

Now, I know people who are going to come up with arguments as to why the uni can’t mandate a vaccine. Well, guess what? They already do! How many nursing/medical/dental etc etc students had to show proof of vaccination before starting their program or clinicals? LITERALLY ALL OF THEM. This is not a new concept. Many international students have to also get vaccinated before starting school in Canada. So what about their “freedom” in this case? Almost seems like a non-issue to me.

If there are students who genuinely cannot get the vaccine for health reasons, I 100% support them (“religious” exemptions or other anti-science rhetoric does not count). But in this case, they would actually benefit more from a vaccine mandate because their chances of protection increases. They would not have to worry because the people they interact with are known to have some immunity.

Lastly, many universities have already decided on vaccination mandates for their returning students. Again this is not some new or radical concept. It has been done before with 0 issue.

If you don’t get vaccinated because you simply don’t want to, that’s fine. Doesn’t give you the right to put your fellow students at risk either. Just my two cents.",1.0

442," Hi all!

My partner just got accepted to McGill and he will be accepting the offer! He is Canadian and I am American. We live in the US and I'd love to join him in Montreal this fall, but the more we learn about immigration, the more discouraged I feel.

If he was an international student, I could have gotten an open work permit the second he got on campus. Since he's a Canadian, I'm excluded from that benefit. It looks like the soonest I'd be able to join him is through spousal sponsorship, which looks like with Quebec's additional steps would be 1.5 years at this point. :( I have a master's in higher education administration and don't speak high enough French to qualify for Express Entry.

444,"So my spouse and I are just getting started on our PR/spousal sponsorship application process. We're going through a lawyer to make sure everything is done correctly. I'm currently still residing in the US during this process. My plan has been to start going to school once I'm a PR and moved over there, but because of covid (and communications from the immigration lawyer literally taking months for us to even get to this point) pushing all our plans back, I'm getting really antsy to start and thinking about trying to start before my PR is approved. I think at least if I go this route I'd be able to move there probably sooner than my PR is approved lol. 

I'm not sure if anyone has ever been in this situation before, but if so, I'm wondering how your experience was. We haven't submitted any of our paperwork/documentation to the lawyer yet, so our application has yet to be submitted. I'm wondering if I should wait until after that's done to consider going this route or to let the lawyer know that's something I want to do before we submit anything. 

Just for context my spouse lives in the Windsor, ON area and the college I want to attend is St. Clair College. Not sure if it makes much of a difference but the program I would be going into would be available entirely online (if not required to be by the time fall semester happens this year lol) so if that's the case I wouldn't even be required to have a study visa to attend classes, I think. The college's site also says spouses of PRs/citizens are considered dependents, so they get the benefit of having resident tuition costs instead of international student costs. If that's the case, I feel like there's no benefit to really holding off on this... but still curious to see if anyone else has been in this situation and what you did. TYIA!",1.0

465,"Disturbed and distressed with Laurier’s mandatory STAQ program. I am an international student returning to Canada to resume my semester. I will be travelling with the required COVID negative certificate. I also have a leased apartment in Waterloo to quarantine for 14 days with no roommate during that period. 

Yet, under Laurier’s STAQ program I am forced to pay CAD 1000 for a compulsory quarantine in an on-campus residence. This payment will be in addition to my housing rental of CAD 700 which I’m already paying. During these challenging financial times, I can ill afford this additional financial burden. How can I be forced to quarantine at the uni when I cannot afford it. 

I’m also worried that my specific diet requirements might be grossly compromised in such a setting. While the world adopts austerity measures &amp; the Govt of Canada too is empathetically in stating “all travellers must arrange for a suitable place to quarantine within one’s financial means,” it’s highly disappointing that Laurier’s STAQ program seems to be insensitive to its international student community who feel grossly discriminated by this rule. 

I would appreciate all fellow hawks to tweet the Students Union twitter and the Wilfrid Laurier University twitter to help me out :(

I'm flying to Canada, Montreal specifically, as an international student.

I'm aware about the 3day mandated quarantine at a govt approved hotel and so I'll be doing it in Toronto, where my point of entry would be.

I was curious, during your quarantine.. When officers come to your place of quarantine to check on you.. Are they allowed to enter the apartment/airbnb and look around inside?

I wanted to ask because I'm a single woman traveling and self isolating so I'm worried about it after reading some articles that there were two cases of sexual harassment from some quarantine inspectors.

I hope everyone is staying safe and in good health amid this outbreak. Sending prayers and wishes to all of you and your loved ones.

As an international student who's not been able to go home due to travel restrictions, and prior plans to earn and save during the summer, I had a game plan to get a summer job that pays decent in order to save up for the next year.

As an international student, fees are anyway high for us and not being able to find a sustainable job is going to be really difficult for me and might hinder my chances of being able to attend uSask next year. At this point my family and I are considering if I should drop a semester just so I can go back home, earn and come back.

I wanted to know if anyone else is in a similar situation and scared about what they're going to do if they don't find a summer job?

I know I'm just venting out, but self isolation isn't helping my overthinking and I'm just trying to make sense of a crazy situation.

Much love to you all.",1.0

I'm traveling to Montreal at the end of December. So since international students must quarantine for 15 days after arrival and have strict rules to follow and show proof for it at the border control, I'm hoping someone who went through the process would shed some light. 

I have an apartment rented but it's a 4 bed 2 bath so the bathrooms are not exclusive to one person. And I guess if we have this kind of situation we can't quarantine in the apartment. [Question: Is this info true]

If we can't quarantine in the apartment then an alternative is to find an Airbnb. So I looked at some of the Airbnb listings and most of them are shared bathroom and by logic we can't opt for them. [Question: What have you chosen?]

Also I heard from my friends from other universities [York and Waterloo] that their universities provide international students the 15day quarantine facility free of cost. [Question : Does McGill have this? Also, any chance I get a room for quarantine in the McGill housing?]

545,"Hi all! I’ve had a pretty rough year academically due to family and personal problems, some health issues, and the whole pandemic going on. Had a 1.68 gpa in fall ‘19 (first term), and 3.3 in winter. Right now trying to recover my gpa (which is around 2.05 right now) by retaking some of my classes. So the problem is, that I want to transfer from econ BA to psyc BA. I already applied to transfer at the begging of fall, got conditionally accepted even though it was my first term (prob bc my HS gpa was 4.0), but bc of my gpa in fall, got rejected. So the question is if I recover my gpa to 3.1 (which is a cutoff), would I still have chances of getting in? Is it harder for internal students? Is my first rejection going to influence their decision? And is the fact of me retaking some classes would look bad? Btw, I’m an international student, if that matters.

I myself am an international student, and I've been in montreal since after reading week in March. I stayed bc I have a... not ideal home situation and I knew i wouldnt handle quarantine with my family very well. 

I understand and support students who want or need to return for the semester because they can't study properly from their home country, like having a shitty home situation (like me) or limited internet/devices. Or you have stuff you need to be in person for, like a job or a lab or something.

But I've seen lots of international (especially American?!) students who want to come back just because they feel like it, and openly discuss ""bullshit"" reasons to give border guards why they ""NEED"" to enter the country when all their classes are online and they have no real reason to return. I mean I dont know for sure what their situations are, but I feel like this goes against the spirit of the border closure. And every single international student coming back, especially from the US, would no doubt lead to a spike in cases here.

It does really suck we can't have an in person classes and I understand students wanting to return to montreal to get some semblance of a normal semester. But we are in a pandemic!

551,"I finished all of my own finals in the first half of the fourth academic year. When I am at home and consider about my own future path after graduation, i feel very pessimistic about my own future.

I do not have a good GPA and am struggling in U of T, and feel very inferior to other peer students in the same program. I don't know what exactly happens to me but I still cannot get a satisfying grade, and this kind of reality makes me feel mentally stressed alongside with the loneliness, anxiety and depression. At the same time, I begin to feel extremely stressful, depressed and anxious from time to time since the second year. Third year is the tough year to me because I failed one course and had to drop one when i got a bad grade in the midterm. At the same time, i need to maintain the full-time student status as an international student, and I made a fault to keep the credits by committing the academic offence, waiting for the ultimate sanction from the academic tribunal. 

I am not saying I am innocent but I do feel that I cannot always be the person that can perform excellently in the academic realm. That feeling of frustration always makes me feel that i am just a useless person and pure loser in this world. I consistently feel very lonely and I don't have a person that I can really talk to, as my parents do not have a good relationship with me, and my parents cannot understand what I am talking about when I tried to communicate with them. After that, I always got into the mood of depression. Over those years, I did not make friends in the campus and I was always busy with a lot of stuff. 

When i am studying in U of T, the mental health issues become severe and critical problems to me when I always feel very depressed, sad and frustrated and lonely from time to time. When it comes to the fact that I am going to graduate in the future, I don't see myself in a positive place in job market or something when I cannot have a nice GPA or good performance in grades, be more competitive than other u of t peers. At the same time, I do not have a nice life here neither when I did not make friends or have somebody that I can share with my own feelings.

At the same time, I tried to apply for positions but all of my applications received any positive replies. Well, I sometimes looked at other people's posts about their own new positions in LinkedIn. From time to time, I see other U of T kids successfully started their own career paths while i am unknown about future. 

I am just feeling emotionally down and getting trapped by the feeling that nobody can really understand me. Maybe others can enjoy the success in academic fields, job markets and relationships etc, they all look like they have the promising futures waiting for them. I ALWAYS DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF MY OWN EXISTENCE IN THE WORLD. I SOMETIMES HAVE THE THOUGHT TO END MY LIFE OR JUST COMMIT SUICIDE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THIS DARK WORLD.

But as i am an international student, i paid nearly 3k in fees for the course so decided to take the exam in all my suffering while i was super unprepared for it. Yesterday i got my grade and I got a C-. I am extremely scared now that I'll be now required to withdraw for my program. I emailed my professor and explained me everything and he said there's nothing he can do to help me. I can stop stressing out and I am still sick, my whole world is falling apart and I don't know what to do.

Im an international student attending to gbc online classes, I wanna go back to Canada for the next semester as it’s my last one but I was hoping I could live in Montreal for the duration of the semester instead of Toronto! I have my study permit and I’m exempt of the travel ban! And as the last semester is the internship I’m trying to give a try to montreaL as I would love to practice French and have a new air!

Recently though, I’ve started wondering what the UofT experience is like for others, specifically international students. It’s not only a new academic environment, like it was for me having been born here, it’s an entirely new country with a new culture and different customs and norms. Maybe even a new language and definitely new demographics. A few questions come to mind then, both individual and larger scale:

1) How are the people at UofT and in Toronto or Canada in general? How welcoming are we really, in terms of the country and also the school in particular?

2) What was it like switching to a new way of socializing or communicating or just being a human trying to make friends here? Or did you mostly stick to your culture’s ways?

3) How does this environment overall and the people in it compare to how it is back home? What do you find you miss from home and what will you miss from here when you go back home?

This school brings people from hundreds of countries together. We Canadians have our own views on what the good and bad is here, but non Canadians each have their own, and the fact that we can hear these views coming from possibly radically different viewpoints is a part of why this school is one of the best.",1.0

626,"I am going back to UofT for my third year by a flight on July 31st. Note: I have a valid study permit. 

When I booked UofT’s quarantine program, under “Eligibility Criteria for Arrivals,” they mention the following rule: “If you arrive more than 3-4 weeks prior to the start of your academic program, you may be refused entry by Canadian Border Services.”

I am very confused; I haven’t read this rule on the government of Canada website. According to the website, I am eligible to come to Canada as a student. 

I tried emailing CIE and the advisor reiterated that I could only arrive 30 days before classes start. I also called border services and they said the same. Specifically, the lady said that any student coming more than 3-4 weeks earlier than classes start will be sent back, and that this is a new rule they are imposing.

As an international student, finding a flight that gives me enough time to move into a new apartment, buy furniture, and get vaccines has been difficult and expensive enough.

634,"I am a first-year international student, but I have been in Canada for over two years now, having graduated from a French school in this city. In my high school years, one could say that I had a social circle that I had gradually built up since my arrival. I have never had a problem making friends; on the contrary, being an introvert, many people mistake me for an extrovert. However, it has always been difficult for me to be close to them, as I've encountered many scenarios where feel I am able to give a lot (communication, trust, empathy...) but receive almost nothing in return. 

Last year (12 grade) I lived one of the best years here in Canada because I had a little circle of amazing friends (all Canadians) where there was no doubt I could count on them. Plus, I had a great host family. I felt heard, supported and most importantly loved. You could even say that I was very sad to go back to my home country during the summer because I was having such a blast with them.

However, I knew things would change here. Having taken different paths and moving to a in-campus residence, it was becoming increasingly difficult to meet with them. Since September, I have only seen them five or six times. I've tried to make a few friends in my classes and in my program, but since they live out of town, it's impossible to meet them in person outside of the class.

Now, this month has been the worst ever. The death of a beloved one has compounded the loneliness I've felt in recent months. I've had to endure one day, crying my eyes out, to be able to talk to someone, face to face. From that day on, my mind implores me to relate to someone and not just a casual conversation, but the need to have that closeness with people that I had a year ago. I feel devastated since I feel like I have no one to talk to about these things who live on campus. Besides, having to speak more English on campus is hard. My speech \[in English\] is sometimes inarticulate, so every time I finish a conversation, I feel very awkward. 

This post spells out the desire I feel to socialize, in person, with people around here, without feeling awkward. I would like to meet someone with whom I can talk, face to face.

People say go watch netflix or play video games but honestly I don't enjoy doing those stuff. I thrive when I am out with people and friends hanging out and enjoying life.

I knew leaving was a risk. But i havent seen my family since 2018. And beign alone in Montréal after 3 years of not seeing my family became pretty depressing. Nd it all felt pointless cause all my courses are online. 

But now i am scared i may not be able to go back by septembre? What would you all do in my position. And is anyone struggling with this. The anxiety is killing me.",1.0

662,"I finished all of my own finals in the first half of the fourth academic year. When I am at home and consider about my own future path after graduation, i feel very pessimistic about my own future.

I do not have a good GPA and am struggling in U of T, and feel very inferior to other peer students in the same program. I don't know what exactly happens to me but I still cannot get a satisfying grade, and this kind of reality makes me feel mentally stressed alongside with the loneliness, anxiety and depression. At the same time, I begin to feel extremely stressful, depressed and anxious from time to time since the second year. Third year is the tough year to me because I failed one course and had to drop one when i got a bad grade in the midterm. At the same time, i need to maintain the full-time student status as an international student, and I made a fault to keep the credits by committing the academic offence, waiting for the ultimate sanction from the academic tribunal. 

I am not saying I am innocent but I do feel that I cannot always be the person that can perform excellently in the academic realm. That feeling of frustration always makes me feel that i am just a useless person and pure loser in this world. I consistently feel very lonely and I don't have a person that I can really talk to, as my parents do not have a good relationship with me, and my parents cannot understand what I am talking about when I tried to communicate with them. After that, I always got into the mood of depression. Over those years, I did not make friends in the campus and I was always busy with a lot of stuff. 

When i am studying in U of T, the mental health issues become severe and critical problems to me when I always feel very depressed, sad and frustrated and lonely from time to time. When it comes to the fact that I am going to graduate in the future, I don't see myself in a positive place in job market or something when I cannot have a nice GPA or good performance in grades, be more competitive than other u of t peers. At the same time, I do not have a nice life here neither when I did not make friends or have somebody that I can share with my own feelings.

At the same time, I tried to apply for positions but all of my applications received any positive replies. Well, I sometimes looked at other people's posts about their own new positions in LinkedIn. From time to time, I see other U of T kids successfully started their own career paths while i am unknown about future. 

I am just feeling emotionally down and getting trapped by the feeling that nobody can really understand me. Maybe others can enjoy the success in academic fields, job markets and relationships etc, they all look like they have the promising futures waiting for them. I ALWAYS DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF MY OWN EXISTENCE IN THE WORLD. I SOMETIMES HAVE THE THOUGHT TO END MY LIFE OR JUST COMMIT SUICIDE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THIS DARK WORLD. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LIFE OR NEXT DECADES WILL LOOK LIKE TO ME.",1.0
663,"I posted this on Piazza but thought I might as well post it here for those of u who arent in the class wondering what its like, and those who dont check piazza:

I am writing this as many people I’ve talked to can relate to a lot of people voicing concerns on Piazza, but felt that some people didn’t expand on their points very eloquently (no offense!) and I would just like to share mine and some peers’ general thoughts on the 137 course so far. Also sorry if my wording-word choice is not great, I am not good at forming out my thoughts in words.
This year is especially hard given we have online learning, which just doesn’t work very well for some people (like me) for various reasons such as understanding things clearly written out (maybe not this type of learner), having ADHD or learning disabilities that make things extra hard, having to work in unideal environments, etc. It is also an unprecedented time and the things that can be done by universities are limited and hard for them to determine the best course of action so I do get this aspect of why people are finding the course hard. However, I do have some concerns/personal feedback on this course.

Even people in upper years now admit that the assessments we are doing this year in 137 are a lot harder than they had (ex. on reddit). There is also an instructor who agrees this year is much harder “I took this course myself years ago and found it challenging to adapt from highschool, so I can't even imagine how much harder this is” https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/jkjeeq/math_137/ A large part of this must be the online learning, but I think that there are a few aspects of the course that are really just making it harder for us than necessary. 

I have heard profs say that this year’s marks for the class are in line with past years. I think that the marks are still in line with past years because a good chunk of people are just doing well because of all the opportunities to cheat in a plethora of ways even if it's just slightly cheating, with assessments being online and unsupervised after all. The instructors must've known this and hence increased the difficulty level of quizzes etc. However, this leaves a number of those who wouldn't want to cheat but are unable to keep up with the difficulty of this course or have difficulty learning in an online format, to see low marks. (Or people who just cannot pass without cheating general). This may actually lead to eventual desperation and cheating, making a big loop back to the beginning issue of cheating (where instructors don’t want this year’s grades to all be super high for unfair reasons). While I understand that most classes in any university like to see this nice bell curve and would like scores in each year to be relatively similar, in the end it is unfair to individual students to have to up the difficulty especially given how hard it is for some people to learn at all on an online format. Now this also causes a lot of anxiety, stress, lack of sleep, and overall strain on mental health especially with the already heavy stress of quarantine for some individuals. 

Talking about specifics, I would like to address the following areas that I take issue with. One thing is the very particular wording on mobius quizzes that needs you to read super thoroughly. This makes it very easy to have silly mistakes made by those who actually understand the material but didn’t read closely enough or have many distractions and couldn’t focus on the wording so much. The wording could be especially confusing to international students who already have a hard time understanding different meanings in English and they seem to have a clear unfair disadvantage. Another thing is how we don’t get any part marks and thus need to know every question extremely well which is even worse coupled with sometimes weird wording. I get that this is a hard one to move around, but for courses such as 135 I feel like it has managed to implement part marks very well (also side note, the fact that we don’t know the number of right answers, as ALL of the questions ask you to choose unlimited choices, adds an additional layer of difficulty). During office hours with a prof, he didn’t even know what the some of the questions were asking and was very confused. I think this fact really reflects the issues with the wording as even a prof couldn’t understand it well. A third thing is how we don’t get to know the correct answers on the mobius which doesn’t help us improve for next time and we have to wait for afterwards when we can check the markbook. But by that time, we would have moved onto concepts taught 2 weeks later, and we could lack the fundamental knowledge from earlier which causes a domino effect of struggling to understand. On a smaller scale, sometimes mobius messes up and marks things incorrectly so not seeing the correct answer causes more confusion and self doubt. Another thing is the fact that a lot of the questions are not explained in videos and we need to make all connections ourselves. Much of the content being actually taught is just the theorems, but how to critically solve questions and what to make of the content is completely up to our own understanding. Also the videos are from several years ago which can be perceived by some as lacking care. 

In response to the idea some people are suggesting about increased attempts on mobius, ex. 5 attempts from now on: I myself did see a mark improvement with the 5 attempts, but I don’t think my actual understanding of information changed much, I just learned what not to choose next time. So, I don’t believe making 5 attempts is a great idea no matter how much I personally would like this, because it doesn’t address the real issue of how many students are struggling to understand the content with the current teaching methods/course structure. I also disagree with people who want to change the overall weighting of the 2 parts of the midterm. I think this would be very unfair as the weights have been set at the beginning of the year and some people actually did well on sections the majority did not. If anything, the difficulty of *future* things could be decreased or we could be given more bonus assignment, etc (I will not speak on my suggestions as the profs know more about what is realistic or actually possible to implement). 

Another thing I won’t address too much as to not spread any rumours based on speculation, is the 225% overacceptance. My personal belief is that the difficulty has also been upped in order to trim down this number, and historically it does make sense. A 225% overaccepted math faculty occurred as they expected many people to defer their acceptance due to covid concerns, but made a big error leading to the overacceptance rate. I cannot speak on any of the 14x courses, but I think that my hypothesis isn’t really applicable for those courses in the first place as those who are less strong with math would choose 13x courses opposed to those who have done the Euclid and proved that they can handle 14x, and by extension, “deserve to at UW”. So 13x courses would be an obvious course to try to use to slim down the population. For example, this course is hard, CS135 is a lot of work, and even 135 started getting a lot harder perhaps because we were all doing really well at the beginning (seen on the mark distributions). This overacceptance rate is certainly frustrating for everyone and must be a very hard issue to deal with for the school, but it is equally frustrating to be given much greater expectations than previous years because of the need to thin down the population. I get this is how universities operate but it is unfair nonetheless that we didn’t contribute to the overacceptance and especially for those who won’t “make the cut” and have to deal with the extra disappointment of failing their requirements (I, for one, would certainly rather not be accepted than come only to waste my time and effort then fail). Again, not saying this is the truth in any way, just my opinion of this year’s difficulty level.

Addressing the midterm specifically because I didn’t see as many people voicing concerns until the midterm: This part is only going to be my personal opinion. I think the mobius parts had the same level of difficulty as normal quizzes, but all mobius quizzes are flawed in my opinion, and the midterm simply really reflected this unfairness. The crowdmark part was certainly harder for me, because of how we didn’t do anything too similar to it before, and it was harder than the crowdmark questions for the past few weeks. Just from my own performance on it.

Finally, I want to say that I do understand this is a very unique time and determining the right way to do anything is extremely difficult especially for profs, I am in no way trying to complain or blame anyone, however I do think this is a struggle for many students that I would like to bring to light with a more thorough explanation. I know that the profs are trying their best in this hard time, and they do care about us. I want to say a big thank you to all the instructors who have to deal with figuring everything out and also monitoring piazza so closely (it’s really awesome, I got a reply at 3am yesterday) and I really appreciate this. Also, there are undoubtedly students who are just able to get very good marks in this course (I will not pretend like everyone is struggling) and I am in no way trying to minimize your effort, good job for those who are doing well! 

Please stay strong and hopeful everyone, I believe in you! And a gentle reminder to please be nice to your fellow students on piazza, we are all trying our best!",1.0

665,"Disturbed and distressed with Laurier’s mandatory STAQ program. I am an international student returning to Canada to resume my semester. I will be travelling with the required COVID negative certificate. I also have a leased apartment in Waterloo to quarantine for 14 days with no roommate during that period. 

Yet, under Laurier’s STAQ program I am forced to pay CAD 1000 for a compulsory quarantine in an on-campus residence. This payment will be in addition to my housing rental of CAD 700 which I’m already paying. During these challenging financial times, I can ill afford this additional financial burden. How can I be forced to quarantine at the uni when I cannot afford it. 

I’m also worried that my specific diet requirements might be grossly compromised in such a setting. While the world adopts austerity measures &amp; the Govt of Canada too is empathetically in stating “all travellers must arrange for a suitable place to quarantine within one’s financial means,” it’s highly disappointing that Laurier’s STAQ program seems to be insensitive to its international student community who feel grossly discriminated by this rule. 

I would appreciate all fellow hawks to tweet the Students Union twitter and the Wilfrid Laurier University twitter to help me out :(

I usually FaceTime my parents before bed and I just start to tear up whenever they mention the smallest things that used to be part of my life when I was home and it just hurts so much to even think about those days when I was surrounded by friends and family. I hate myself for feeling this way but I just want to be a child again and let my parents take care of me. I know I need to grow up and be responsible for my own decisions like most people my age do. And I’ve been doing great in terms of taking care of myself physically and managing money etc, I eat healthy I love cooking I workout and I don’t splurge on unnecessary things. But I just can’t get rid of that feeling of wanting to be taken care of again and I just miss being home so much.

So the problem is, that I want to transfer from econ BA to psyc BA. I already applied to transfer at the begging of fall, got conditionally accepted even though it was my first term (prob bc my HS gpa was 4.0), but bc of my gpa in fall, got rejected. So the question is if I recover my gpa to 3.1 (which is a cutoff), would I still have chances of getting in? Is it harder for internal students? Is my first rejection going to influence their decision? And is the fact of me retaking some classes would look bad? Btw, I’m an international student, if that matters.

Has anyone else had bad experiences where they give you a hard time transferring scripts when you're an international student? Not being given proper treatment/ having the problem downplayed? Asking for referrals because your having health issues and being told that a completely unrelated doctor that you're also getting a referral to will handle it?

Been a student for 3 years and had to go 4 months without my meds when I first got here because they had to discuss my meds with my doctor from home because they thought I shouldn't be on Concerta because they thought my diagnosis of ADHD was fake so that I could get the meds just to boost my studying. Got a severe concussion that I was told was minor and to rest for a couple of days and that I would be fine after a month, after 5 months and when I was finally able to go home and see my doctor I was diagnosed with post-concussive depression and severe memory problems which I suspected and during that 5 months at school, I had to argue with the school just to get a referral to get an MRI (over a month after it happened) which turns out for a concussion should be done within the first week otherwise it won't show anything and then they stopped me from getting the results for over a month. Then when I ask for a few referrals (3) they only send me (2) and tell me that the allergist referral will handle my gastrointestinal problems (even though I need to get an endoscopy to confirm if I am celiac and the doctor told me that my blood test for it came back positive so I already have it, WHICH ISNT TRUE, it means you have the genetics for it but that it can only be confirmed through an endoscopy) and so they won't give me a referral for a GI doctor because supposedly and allergist can handle any possible gut issues I have (they can guess, but they will still end up telling me to see a GI doctor). 

So basically, I have never once had a good experience with Concordia's health services, have always been given extremely rushed care (visits are 10 minutes or less and the nurses you see prior are more helpful than the stupid doctor I always end up with), half the time the doctor just asks me ""what do I think is wrong with me"" and then says ok diagnoses me with that problem and then gives me referrals/prescriptions for the WRONG THING. If you are able to go to a CLSC and can afford to pay and wait to be reimbursed do that because Concordia's health services will be absolutely no help to you!",1.0

Idk what to do i am so stressed. I am an international student and this will fuck up everything.",1.0
682,"Okay ill start off with my idea of how we should or hopefully can move forward with things.

1. we should open the university fully (of course when covid is under control, whether that is in fall or winter) so that we can return to a normal learning/university experience, as this will be beneficial for many people.
2. we should adopt a system that allows for inperson lectures to be recorded and these should be available to students online. this will be beneficial to those that cannot make it to set lecture times because of other responsibilities or if they are sick (or any reason really) as they can watch at their own convenience.
3. all exams and assessments should be in person. nothing really to change here. 
4. divide office hours/small tutorials into inperson and virtual sessions. so if a professors hold two office hours per week, one of them could be in person and the other could be on zoom. so if you cant make it in person, you can ask questions at home or wherever you have internet access. 
5. look at offering more virtual learning software's. So I'm thinking like making virtual simulations or experiments that can be completed/ used at home. these would be optional but can be beneficial as they would act as an interactive learning resource that can be accessed conveniently. For students that cannot complete labs or such in person (for legitimate reasons and not because they don't want too), these can be supplemented for marked/weighted labs.
6. offer more virtual events in the university. Basically every club in the university has been hosting events online. It would be awesome if we could keep some of these events, like virtual game nights, and zoom networking sessions, etc. this way, students that can't stay after classes, or can not attend events in person, still have opportunities to participate with clubs and other students. 
7. tying into the point above, maybe we could  implement zoom tutoring sessions, here and there, so students can get the help they need with ease.

Okay so some people hate online school, and some people love it.

Starting with my personal opinion, I hate online school because my mental and even physical health has really declined over the past year. I cant speak for everyone obviously, but for me personally, going to university was really all I had. I don't have an active social life. I don't live a life where I can just go out every few days to a café with friends. I don't have a part time job or something that I can go to. and I don't know how to explain it, but I'm sitting at this weird position where I want to get out and participate in different activities and clubs, but I pull myself back, and honestly it could just be anxiety but who knows. I've also been finding it difficult to do well in school. I don't have a lot of people that I can reach out to for help, and nothing can really replace sitting with a group of classmates and really working through  problems together in person. It is also difficult to just stay motivated with school when there really aint anything else to look forward too. I try to stay optimistic each day and I'm pushing myself through this by being grateful for all that I have, and finding the good in this situation. I also have seen people point out the issues they deal with when it comes to inperson learning, but since I don't find those to be issues for me, (I'm probably just weird), I don't oppose going back to in person learning.

on the other hand, I realize just how great online school must be for other people. I mean if you have opportunities to go out and meet and interact with people, your learning hasn't been affected negatively with online learning, and you found it painful to get up and go to uni, it makes sense to me why you would want it to remain online, so you can easily learn at your own pace, and have plenty of time in the day to chill and do as you please.

Aside from the simple opinion of I love/hate online school, I realize that there may be students and professors out there that have other major responsibilities (such as part time jobs), or dependents that they need to care of (like children or older parents), or are dealing with a disability, which makes inperson learning difficult. I can imagine how beneficial online school is for this select group, as it makes getting an education much more accessible.

With this in mind, I feel like we should strive to move towards something that lies in the middle.",1.0
683,"I need help.

I'm lying in bed with a knife and all i want to do is end it all. I've fucked up every opportunity I had and pushed away everyone. I don't know what to do I don't know who to reach out for help anymore. I have tried to reach out for help and nothing. Nothing gets better, I just end up feeling like shit again. I'm an international student and I haven't talked to my family for a while. My mom for month my brother for years. I have no support, nothing. No future anymore. I can't see the light anymore I want to be able to climb out of this hole but I keep calling deeper. I'm in debt and can't pay my tuition fees which means I can't stay here anymore.

Thank you for continuing to neglect our elders while pretending to be surprised by the extent to which they are neglected. Thank you for purposefully throwing people into the arms of what you call ""a serious situation"" while you laugh and squeeze your meaty fist tighter on our rights. Thank you for putting everything on ""the good faith of all Quebecers"" as opposed to actually policing the infected and returning from abroad, even when the numbers (and literally anyone) should've been enough to tell you that you should've. Thank you for funneling 5 million dollars into a racist, backward, useless branch of government that does nothing but give small local businesses grief about the dumbest little things about their business as opposed to, I don't know, putting it into the health system? Priorities, man, priorities. Thank you for shutting down the protests. The BLM ones, at least, had a cause, but those anti-mask protesters should have been (and should be, because they're not going to stop) forced home, not given as much room as they wanted to be as many as they wanted packed in without masks as they were. They were literally there to snub their noses at the new regulations, and them succeeding only emboldened others, and also set a precedent for every other large gathering to follow (""there's 10000 people protesting in the streets right now, we can be (insert number greater then 10 but less than 20 here)""). Thank you for reopening schools in a ""business as usual"" model for ""students' mental health"". Fuck everybody else's mental health when that goes wrong, right? Thank you, by the way, for half-assing that back to school plan. Jam 18+ kids into a classroom, then put it on us when it goes wrong. Because when you put something as ""business as usual"", 2 things happen: people act that way (students walking home), and others that wouldn't say ""well, fuck it, schools are full, we can be more than 10!"" (the 18-35s you like to blame for everything). And the latest, thank you for this other round of confinement; you guys probably planned for this when bill 61 didn't pass, right? ""I gave you a chance to willingly accept my dictatorship, now let's open schools to bump up the cases and force you to!"". Last time you said 14 days, it lasted 3 months. Now 28 days, who wants to place a bet? Not a care in the world for the people who live without their main support system, doing online classes that just get more and more frustrating the more you realize how lost the teacher is. Also, not a care in the world for people who live with their parents and whose parents \*crucify\* them for having the nerve to call it as it is as opposed to bending over and taking it quietly and without argument (don't get me wrong, I won't argue with someone over putting a stupid piece of cloth over my face to enter a building, but I do have a comment every time I hear the latest stupid decision, especially concerning gatherings, for reasons enumerated above). Thank you for not letting me spend a nice calm night watching a movie with my girlfriend now because of \*your\* negligence. Especially after frustrating class and even more frustrating day-to-day shit, it was nice to have that one constant ray of light in my week. Work work, pay pay, right? Nothing's allowed unless you make a buck! I followed your rules. I stayed in my region as much as possible, I kept my distance from everyone, I kept gatherings small, I stayed home and really only had one regular social contact, and I wore my mask. But you didn't keep your end of the bargain, and it's not right that people like me  the followed instructions have to pay for it with our mental health, as well as people my age having to pay for your mistakes (monetarily) until the day we die. Thanks for that, too. I really hope to see the lot of you finally forced to take responsibility for all of this, because those almost 6000 deaths are on you and your constant flip-flopping, lack of control over the infected and returning from trips, loosening of self-quarantine restrictions, lack of control over protests against \*science\*, and your actions completely contradicting your words. Maybe personally reimbursing every Quebecer that has had to seek therapy because of this, or paying everyone who actually played nice a sum for their cooperation. Wait, you don't even know who played nice because you have no idea who didn't! So one last time, thank you, I appreciate everything you've done so far.

The money is going towards necessities and tuition, but that doesn't exactly matter right now. I considered myself to be eligible because I saw this:

 ""you completed or expect to complete high school, or received, or expect  to receive your high school equivalency in 2020, and have applied for a  post-secondary educational program that starts before February 1, 2021"" (copied and pasted from [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit/cesb-who-apply.html))

as one of the main qualifications, and because UEO is a post-secondary program, and I graduated in March, I thought I was eligible. I just recently, when applying for the last period of CESB, saw this:

""A **post-secondary educational program** means a series  of courses taken over a period of 12 weeks or longer and considered by  the educational institution to be necessary to obtain a degree, diploma,  or certificate. 		

**Post-secondary level** means education at a university  or college level, including education of a technical or vocational  nature and vocational training at the secondary level in Quebec.""

My plan was always to spend a year in UEO taking some gneds and CS courses, and then transfer to CS the following year. Is there any possibility I won't have to pay back what I've taken from CESB?

I’m essentially paying for powerpoint slides that are directly from the textbook, and then I end up having to YouTube a lot of problems anyway.

699,"Dear Concordia student,

Whether you’re in Montreal or somewhere else in the world, these are exceptional times. I hope you and those close to you are healthy, and that you are managing the inevitable stress and disruption caused by this ever-evolving situation.

I’m writing today to inform you that Concordia’s fall 2020 term will be delivered almost entirely online, accessible anytime, from anywhere in the world.

Why? We need to prioritize the health of our community and exercise our civic responsibility as a large institution in the City of Montreal. Public health authorities have been clear that physical distancing will prevail in Montreal for an indefinite period. As at so many North American universities, proper physical distancing is very hard to maintain on our two campuses. Moving the bulk of our fall term online is the responsible choice.

A few exceptions to online course delivery will be made for activities where a hands-on element is key — for example, experiments, teaching labs and studio work that require a physical demonstration of skills and competencies. Provided that appropriate health and safety measures can be observed, those activities will take place on campus, but with fewer participants than usual, attending on a rotating basis. We are currently identifying in-person course activities across all faculties, and will share this information as soon as we know more.

That said, we remain committed to providing an online version of in-person sessions for those who cannot, or choose not to, attend for any reason. This is part of our commitment to be accessible and equitable. Whether you’re a student in your home country or your Montreal apartment, you will be able to fulfill your course requirements.

For graduate students, I’m pleased to announce that limited access to research labs will gradually resume starting May 25. Your supervisor will be informed of the schedule we’re creating to ensure we all adhere to physical distancing guidelines.

Although our libraries remain physically closed, access to digital collections, “Ask a Librarian,” consultations with subject librarians, interlibrary loans and other online services are functional, and will continue to expand to include instruction and additional digital resources. We are planning to provide restricted access to our physical collections over the summer and fall terms.

To ensure your views are part of our plan, starting next week we’ll be sending out surveys to current and prospective students.

The Times Higher Education Impact Rankings (April 2020) put Concordia as the number one university in Canada for ""quality education."" That’s why we’re putting all our efforts into providing a quality education and preparing you for whatever you’re planning next.

To help you get there, we will also be increasing and adapting our student services to support you through this exceptional time. We will provide:

More online student advising
More online mental health counselling
More peer-to-peer and mentoring exchanges
Virtual campus-life opportunities to help combat isolation
We will also be exploring ideas and building partnerships to help our students enjoy the Montreal experience — one of our great assets — virtually.

We will send additional updates over the summer to prepare you for a fall term unlike any other.

If you have questions in the interim, you can direct them to covid19info@concordia.ca.
You can also consult our COVID-19 FAQ, which we update regularly.
Remember, our mission is to help you succeed and your success is our greatest pride.

I appreciate your patience and perseverance during this unprecedented situation, and wish you all the best over the summer and beyond. Even if virtually for the time being, I look forward to welcoming you or welcoming you back to Concordia, Canada’s next-gen university.

700," The university has created a COVID-19 Emergency Bursary available to all students—domestic or international, undergraduate or graduate—who are experiencing emergency financial need as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding is intended to provide for students’ urgent and emerging needs and enable them to continue their academic programs in this rapidly shifting learning environment. Examples of circumstances that will be taken into consideration include job loss; access to housing, food, tuition, or technology to facilitate online/remote learning; mental health services; child care; transportation; and other emerging needs directly related to the impact of COVID-19 on student life.

To start the application process, send a brief explanation of how you have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 situation to Student Awards and Financial Aid (SAFA) at [finaid@uvic.ca](mailto:finaid@uvic.ca).

705,"I am a teacher in a remote community in Alberta.  We have had exactly 1 household with Covid so far, related to out of town travel,  and it did not spread beyond their home.  I am not writing this to suggest I deserve praise for doing my job, which I am thankful to still have. My position is likely much better than the majority of my teaching colleagues, and my heart goes out to them.

 Many parents are asking what my opinion is of how safe schools are for their kids right now.  I am very limited by what I can say in rl.  All I can say is that my own children are not attending their city schools right now.  As well, I can't say it but, the learning that is being done this year is not up to pre-covid levels.

I have a combination of parents sending their kids to school, and repeatedly pulling them from class at every rumour, and kids who travel to Edmonton, fly in on Sunday, and back in class Monday morning.  A lot of my time and attention is directed at keeping everyone as safe as possible during Covid, instead of towards teaching.  More of my time and attention is directed at trying to get kids needs, other than educational needs, met this year.  They are stressed out, their families are stressed out.  This stress is exhibiting itself in elevated behaviours, as you would expect.  This is despite the fact we are in what is likely the safest part of the province.

I have a class of 14 kids in person, the rest online, and it is impossible to maintain social distancing at school.  But hey, we were told by the CMOH in September that we didn't need to maintain social distancing, unless it is possible.  I have 14.  Most city schools in Elementary have 25-35 in class, and even less room to social distance in their classrooms.

I personally am aware of active covid cases in schools in the province that are unreported on any government list.  I don't have the official covid letters to send to Support our Students, but if you receive one please send it to that website.  My niece is currently in Grade 6 in Airdrie, and is on her 3rd or 4th round of isolation as a close contact.  None of those cases have appeared on the government website as school cases, and in one case she got the quarantine order 2 days before her 14 days were through, so she isolated for 2 days.

My class is split between kids who did all of their online learning, and kids who did zero online.  Thanks to Kenney blindly promoting everyone, regardless of if they did any learning or not, many did nothing.  Of those who did nothing from March 15 to June 28th, half chose online schooling for September and October.  They, of course, did nothing.  

For many, no learning was done until we got permission to send home progress reports that stated their child would not be blindly promoted again.  In effect I'm teaching a split grade class, but for many, they had 8 months off to fool around online.  They have forgotten a great deal, especially in math.  They are not happy to be back on a schedule, and don't have much endurance for learning  yet.

My point of view is that students in school will be as safe as we can make them.  If you don't believe teachers will do our best for your kids, know at least that most of us would do the best possible job out of self-interest, if nothing else.  

Every family will need to choose for themselves, how comfortable they feel with ancient HVAC systems, students unable to social distance, some kids families acting as though nothing at all is going on, and the inevitable less-than-perfect mask wearing of young kids.

If you are not comfortable with sending your young kids to school, but worry that their learning will be sub-optimal at home with you, know that these challenges are there in the classrooms.  Teachers will do their best when online teaching, as we do in the school classroom.  There is a good chance your kids learning will be less disrupted at home, if only because they won't be repeatedly in quarantine.

Probably not a terribly satisfying read, but there it is.  We are all doing our best, and I don't know that throwing money at the problem of social distancing kids at school would really work, as it would require more teachers than we actually have, even if every teacher in the province who wanted to work was working.  I am not a fan of shutting down schools as a blanket solution either, the students who dropped off our radar quickest were those at risk of abuse and other at risk children.  It's a hard year.

Re: COVID update #4: In-person classes suspended next week, university remains open, update on residences and travel



In the interest of ensuring alignment between our affiliated institutions, we are sending this update jointly to our respective Dalhousie and King’s communities in Halifax, Truro and elsewhere. Please review this entire message carefully as there are several new developments.


Over the past several weeks, we have been preparing diligently for the impacts of COVID-19. We know our community is large and complex, with significant mobility of our people. Given the current public health situation, and in consultation with both Nova Scotia Public Health and government officials as well as our other postsecondary partners, it is time for our institutions to take concrete measures to encourage social distancing and limit the spread of the virus. The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff is highest priority, and it is vital we do our part to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. These measures reflect our unique circumstances for Dalhousie and King’s. We recognize the situation for other institutions may be different and those institutions may need to respond differently.


We have taken many measures to date and are announcing additional measures today in response to the latest information from Public Health. We ask your patience as we work through additional details and decisions and will share more next week.


In-person classes suspended next week


In-person classes and labs for Dalhousie and King’s students will be suspended next week (March 16-20) as a preventative measure to increase social distancing and allow instructors time to shift to alternative means of teaching.


We are working to ensure that, despite these disruptions, students will be able to complete their academic year. Our intention is to begin transitioning classes into a temporary remote teaching environment (such as online, etc.) for the remainder of the term. We expect classes will be suspended at least a week before they recommence. Instructors will receive further instructions through their Deans or Program Directors in the coming days. In-person exams will not take place on campus. More details to come next week. We will be consulting with CONSUP (Council of Nova Scotia University Presidents) and NS Public Health on next steps.


Clinical placements, research activities and co-op work placements are continuing.


Residences — those who can move out are encouraged do so


Residences remain open. We request those students who are able to move out to do so by Sunday, March 22. Please be assured that anyone who cannot return home for reasons such as international travel restrictions, serious personal reasons, or university obligations will continue to be provided accommodation. Those who move out by March 22 will receive a prorated refund (room and meal plan) deposited to their student account. Please note, for students’ continued safety we reserve the right to move students to another residence. Students in residence can expect to receive additional information by email shortly.


University remains open


University offices and buildings remain open. Our decision to suspend classes represents a measure to reduce large gatherings of people in line with public health advice. Research operations will continue.


Further information on HR procedures for employees are being provided to leaders across the university shortly. Please consult with your director, department chair or supervisor for more information.


Cancellation of events and activities


In line with Public Health advice, non-essential university-sanctioned events must be cancelled or postponed at this time. The Dalhousie Presidential Installation (March 30) is also cancelled and may be rescheduled to a later date. The situation with campus events will be reassessed as we go forward.


All non-essential university travel suspended, self-isolation for travellers


All non-essential student, faculty and staff travel for university purposes is now suspended. Any exceptions must be approved by the Provost, or in the case of King's, the Vice-President.


In line with Public Health advice, all those who have travelled internationally or from any provinces with confirmed cases of COVID-19 should self-isolate upon their return for 14 days. For employees, this time will not be taken from an employee’s vacation or sick leave bank; employees are expected to work from home, where possible.


Final thoughts


A reminder that the Public Health Agency of Canada and Nova Scotia Public Health remain the best source for up-to-date public information on this rapidly changing situation. More information related to Dalhousie can be found at dal.ca/coronavirus and related to King's at ukings.ca/coronavirus. In the coming days we will continue to update our Frequently Asked Questions on those sites to address common concerns.


These are exceptional times, unprecedented in the modern history of our institutions. We know these measures represent a significant disruption to our operations. No aspect of our mission is unaffected. We are, truly, all in this together.


To our students… we are doing everything we can to limit the impact on your studies, and we are here to support you. We know this is a stressful time. Practise empathy with your peers and reach out if you need support of any kind.


To our faculty, staff and instructors… your commitment to our students and their academic experience is what makes Dalhousie and King’s such great institutions. We know that commitment remains strong. We’re here for what you need in making this difficult situation work for our students.


To everyone in our shared community… Ours is a strong community — and that strength is grounded in our compassion for one another. Now is the time to draw on that strength as we come together and prepare to come through this situation even stronger and more compassionate. Be kind to each other.

707,"Hi guys,

I know that Canada doesn't provide coverage for non-Canadian citizens. 

However, I have a friend who is very near suicide, has to leave the country they have a student visa in, and return to the US where they have no coverage or money. They DESPERATELY need medication and know that they do.

I want to help somehow in this way. Bring them up here, they can stay with me no problem. But I have to somehow find a solution for the medicine. At this point, they don't even have the willpower to seek out services in the US (they hate it there... passionately... for family and other reasons - but Canada is in their good books at least).

Does anyone know how a visitor to Canada could access medical care (mental health services/medication)?

I'm going through 100 various means to prevent this act and improve their life condition even if just by a little, as well as listening and empathizing. Please please just focus on the question as I'm trying to organize my thoughts and feelings so I don't become overwhelmed quite so quickly.

This has been horrible. Please be kind. I'm hurting too, and trying to be strong while breaking inside.",1.0
708,"Tbh these days I just don’t have the passion for studying. My life is in a passive circle ever since the coronavirus outbreak in China half a month ago. The very first thing I see every morning is the notification of thousands of new deaths happened over night. MY whole family lives in the very center of  Chongqing, a city among top five of the cities with the most ppl infected. Now the holiday is almost over and my parents have to go to work in very few days but they still haven’t been able to buy enough face masks for themselves and my younger brother studying in a local boarding school. I just can’t stop worrying all of my families and friends all the time. It’s not only me, but also almost every Chinese I know, including my roommate from Guangdong, who hasn’t been sleeping in a few days. However, I don’t think McGill is fully aware of what Chinese McGillians are going through. McGill is already pretty stressful, and all these pressure and worries just make it worse. So here I’m calling to ask for McGill university to provide additional emotional support opening to all students who think they have been affected by coronavirus outbreak. Anyone who thinks additional emotional support is a necessary measure can just like or leave a comment under this post to show your support. Moreover, I do hope everyone who sees this post and their families and friends can make through this hard period. I do understand the first month is this new decade has been tough, but as long as we stick together it will end up just fine.",1.0
709,"Dear colleagues,  

I hope you are well and safe as we continue to navigate our way through these challenging times together. They are unprecedented in our lifetimes and call upon the great strengths of our university community.

Yesterday, the Chair of the Board of Governors shared the news that I have agreed to stay on in my role as President beyond my planned end date of June 30, 2020. The Chair emphasized the need for stability and continuity right now and I am committed to serving you until the university is in a better position for the transition to new leadership.

## Thank you for everything you're doing

To some it might look like we are slowly closing down the university, given all the recent measures we have enacted to slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our community strong and healthy. I want to assure you, however, that while on-campus life has certainly slowed, our university remains open and active—albeit in a different way than usual.

In reality, just behind the scenes, there is a cast of thousands who are delivering courses to students with the aid of technology, who are continuing our critical research within physical distancing requirements, and who are working on-campus and remotely to provide our core services to students and employees.

From every quarter of our university, I am hearing heartening stories about the innovative and proactive approaches our faculty, staff and students are taking to get the job done.

Thank you again for your exceptional levels of engagement and flexibility through these uncertain times.

## Supporting each other now and for the future

While the immediate future of this global event is uncertain, we continue to plan, as best we can, for all possible scenarios. Since I last wrote, many have been hard at work preparing for the summer academic term to ensure students who want to learn, can.

We have also established [new bursaries](https://www.uvic.ca/covid-19/home/updates/emergency-bursary-31march2020.php) for students experiencing emergency financial need as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our faculty have been making every effort to ensure students can complete this current term and receive credit for their hard work to date.

Our staff quickly mobilized, transferring their work lives to their homes. Those staff who remain on campus are maintaining operations while physically distancing.

I remain deeply appreciative of our faculty, staff and students who have answered the call to work remotely. Your distance is keeping our campus safe for those members of the UVic community who have to be here as they attend to the health and safety of others, and maintain our facilities and infrastructure.

I would like to acknowledge all of our dedicated onsite staff, whether you are in residences, housekeeping, food services, security or facilities management. Thank you.

We are continuing to provide assistance to our students who were on international placements to return to Canada, as well as those on campus who have been able to head home early.

We are also working to ensure that our students who hoped to celebrate their convocation in June 2020 are able to do so, perhaps at a different time or through different means.

## Planning for what's next

The business of the university continues as well.

Our Board of Governors met via video conference earlier this week and approved the university’s 2021-2023 Planning &amp; Budget Framework. You will shortly be hearing more about that from your budget leads. Much work remains to fully understand the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our students and the university, but I can assure you there is extensive work underway to do so and the university will be prudent in its approach.

I know you will all be interested in the state of the university and our plans for the future and we will try to communicate frequently. None of us have ever experienced anything like this and there is no playbook but I can assure you we will always be doing what we think is the right thing, based on the information that we have.

## UVic is part of the solution

We are also considering how we can contribute further to our region’s and nation’s response to the significant disruptions that are taking place.

As you can imagine, our campus community has been very active and creative in finding ways to respond to the crisis. From offering much needed advice and expertise to necessary research, UVic is committed to being there for our communities.

Our response will evolve as we work together with other post-secondary institutions, public health officials and our provincial and federal governments to do our part to slow and reduce the rate of COVID-19 transmission. Updates on our efforts will continue to be shared on social media and through a new dedicated website.

## We are all in this together

The last few weeks have been nothing like we could have ever imagined. I am continuously inspired by how people find new ways to take care of each other in our communities.

We are all in this together.

I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to follow public health guidelines but I also want to encourage you to take some time each day to focus on your mental health and wellness. Make sure to get outside to the extent advised by health authorities, enjoy our beautiful Pacific coast environment, make virtual connections with family and friends, and seek out positive stories.

UVic continues to monitor the provincial, national and global situation and we will keep you updated with any news that affects our institution. We are committed to meeting the immediate needs created by this global challenge, while planning for a time when we can return to our normal work routines.

I thank each and every one of you again for all your efforts.

Together, we will emerge from this crisis as an even stronger and more connected community.

710,"I have some questions for PFC about a few things, my and my fiancee situation is very specific. Just to re-iterate we should be fine with not losing our house and we should be fine with feeding our kids in this time. I understand this isn't an emergency situation but  it does basically eat an emergency fund we had already allocated and the back-up back-up plan is selling RRSP which lets face it no one wants to do right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

For starters my Fiancee was laid off after finding out she was pregnant about two years ago (August 2018). It was directly related to her requiring to work from home for 3 days through means outside her control. Lots to digest in that but her hands we're seriously tied and we believe it cost her her job. She went on EI and that was basically it for about 12 months. My son was born in April 2019, and her EI ran out roughly August 2019. Now in April she had claimed single for her CCB  which she shouldn't have done. We were technically common law so now she owed CRA 3900 from CCB and GST. This was found out about November so she received no benefit for January and February.  Combined with her tax return from EI (\~$1500) she has an amount owing of about $2600. Ironically this was right after she made a $2500 deposit on a lawyer for child custody/child support with her ex, so even more great timing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is she in any kind of situation to receive the additional money from CCB or will they simply say you're not getting the money anyway too bad? Will it at least be applied to her debt so we receive that money faster?  Whats the threshold for this/cut offs for employment situations as I only lost my second part time job? 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally I had about $1800 in TFSA, VGro mostly which I was planning to use for the wedding. Now we're pretty on budget for it and we have an extra $3k on wedding day that we were going to use for the honey moon so not having access to this isn't the end of the world. Clearly with the dip I don't want to use it and I'm just diverting my additional savings to HISA as I'm going to be using it soon. Was a risk, didn't pay off, but we can power through that. The thing is we had about $3300 in E-fund which due to her not getting any benefits is starting to be chunked away here and there. We've used some of this for wedding related purchases (our rings mostly) which we seen as an expense regardless of wedding postponement or not. It's at roughly $1600 right now.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest hit is the lack of my part time job. March April are normally very lucrative months. I'd projected I would get around $2000 from these two months alone after tax (closer to $3500 pre tax) combined with savings dwindling and the potential 2-3k hit on changing the wedding date and the fact our lawyer could ask for more money to go to court which we had ready in hand at the time but may not be in a situation to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

My credit is fairly busting at the moment with 2 cars (one paid for by work), the mortgage entirely in my name, a student LOC, a regular LOC with \~70% utilization, and 5 year $10k loan that's just on year 3 ($6k left on it)  and my CC with $1500 on it that I cycle my normal spending through (I don't really ever get charged interest as I cycle through $1500/21 days fairly regularly on the card. So an additional LoC would likely be at quite a large interest rate/not obtainable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is the Mortgage deferral program a good fit for my situation or even the low interest loans? I am paying a good amount of debt each month (\~$800/mnth minus Company paid car + Mortgage) and things were really coming together to get us through the wedding financially while still getting all my loans sorted out. The 2-4 mortgage payments off set would next almost $2k that would just put so much stress off me and the family right now to know it's there if I need it kind of deal.

&gt;Fall 2020 at Lakehead University
Thunder Bay , Orillia

As we head into the May long-weekend, we turn some monumental corners: the recent end to a semester that won't soon be forgotten, springtime temperatures that beg us to go outside, the start of our spring/summer session, and now news about what we should expect in the fall.

September at Lakehead University has always been a time of celebration and beginnings. This fall will be no different as we welcome students, faculty and staff to the start of our 55th academic year. A year of celebration, but one tempered by the global realities that challenge each and every member of our Lakehead community.

As I write this, I must acknowledge that this fall will differ from our previous experiences at Lakehead University in many ways. As Lakehead welcomes students to start the 2020/21 academic year in September, we will continue to operate in an environment shaped by the ongoing global pandemic. We will do so with a focus on prioritizing the health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff as we continue to deliver a high-quality educational experience.

At all stages of our operations, we will adhere to the advice of our local health authorities and guidelines set by the Canadian and Ontario governments. Recently, the Province of Ontario began announcing steps to reopen certain types of businesses and gradually lifting restrictions with a focus on health and safety in Ontario's communities. While the timing of this reopening phase evolves, Lakehead's planning for Fall 2020 is influenced by these guidelines.

Lakehead University is planning for primarily-online and alternative delivery models of courses in Fall 2020.


The Lakehead Approach

Lakehead remains committed to high-quality remote and alternative forms of program delivery and, where possible, in-person experiences such as research labs, experiential learning opportunities, and select courses that can be modified to ensure a high quality and safe learning experience. We understand that our learners have unique needs - now more than ever - and commit to offering educational opportunities designed to provide the Lakehead experience to our students with the same focus on exceptional, inclusive learning that is the foundation of our University. Our Faculties are assessing individual programs and working to build an environment that continues to fulfill our academic mission in teaching and research. As these program plans are unveiled, more information will be shared to assist students in making informed decisions and course selections.


Supporting our Students

As we plan for Fall 2020, Lakehead is working to ensure that the necessary supports are provided for our students, particularly those experiencing financial challenges, or who need extra advising, counselling or wellness supports.

In addition to our own supports, the Government of Canada recently announced a $9 billion economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic that includes the Canada Emergency Student Benefit to be delivered by the Canada Revenue Agency.

Finally, the Province of Ontario has announced that its Ontario Student Assistance Program loans will not require payments from students and no interest will be charged between March 30 and September 30, 2020. Payments students make during that period of time will be applied to paying down the principal of their respective loans.

Health and Safety

While we are all looking forward to a return to campus, it is important to stress that health and safety remains our first priority as we continue to ensure that our plans and approach are consistent with provincial public health guidelines.

Our Lakehead COVID-19 Transition Committee will lead consultation and engagement with stakeholders across the University. The decisions Lakehead University will make in the coming months will be guided by information from our local health authorities while complying with national and provincial laws, guidelines and directives.

As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, we will adapt our decisions and preparations in order to provide a safe and healthy learning and working environment for our students, faculty and staff. In this new environment, we must be prepared to adopt new habits of social and physical distancing, hand hygiene, and will have to adapt to the evolving advice and guidance from our Health Units and governments.

Stronger, Together

Over the past months, every member of our Lakehead community has faced and overcome a variety of personal, and study- or work-related challenges. As a University community, we have united, continuing to deliver high quality programming, and focusing on student success.

During this time, we have seen an amazing display of innovation, collaboration, resilience and endurance at all levels of the University. Our campuses have remained secure, clean, and welcoming to those students who still call our campuses home. Many Lakehead services have transitioned to virtual environments to ensure continuity of programming, student financial aid and wellness supports. We have advanced COVID-19-related research and worked to support our local health-care system.

Lakehead continues to be an integral part of the Thunder Bay, Orillia and regional communities. As such, we have not lost sight of the key educational partnerships we have in Simcoe County and Northwestern Ontario and the strength of these collaborations in building a network of opportunities for learners across the region. We will also continue the important community service and research programs in place and look to expand our relationships as our communities strive to address the challenges of our COVID-19-impacted world.

We have been through a lot together in these last eight weeks.

Looking ahead, I am excited to see how Lakehead can continue to create enriching experiences this fall. I know I speak for all of us at Lakehead when I say we look forward to ongoing engagement as we look towards Fall 2020.

712,"So this is more of an opinion question than actual covid relation but,

Do you think we’ll ever go back to normal? Now I’m not saying our normal was working for us in the slightest, there was always something could have always been done differently that’s for sure.  

Do you ever think we’ll be able to trust a stranger in the street again or sit in a specific spot on ETS or in a park? 
Do you think we’ll ever have faith in our provincial or federal government again?
Do you think we will underestimate the importance of service workers again?
Do you think we’ll ever travel via car/bus the same, or even fly ‘comfortably’ again?
Are we going to be like this for another few weeks? Months? Years? 

As an introvert this whole thing hasn’t done too much to my mental health but I would like to go outside and not worry I’ll bring back a virus, or get criticized because I’m walking down the street from the grocery store. 
I’d like to be able to go to WEM to window shop or look for new clothes, or just go somewhere to get something special to eat or drink. 
I’d like to be go to university and sit in a classroom and converse with friends about how something bugged me or just a quick chitchat in between classes.
I want to be able to go to a store and not have to wonder, “are they even open? Are they essential?” 

Most of all, I want to be able to think of going to school with an end goal of being able to move to my dream country as an exchange student and work towards a career that may not even be needed anymore if this continues. 

While I did mention this self isolation hasn’t done much to my mental health, I’d like to state that I do feel purposeless and I’m wondering if I should even continue what I’m working towards and just go back into what is now the highest demand of employment, service work.
Im no conspiracy theorist nor a doomer, but I am constantly thinking of the negative “what if’s” in that this is all society will be until a massive chunk of the population is gone, or the virus becomes a normal thing LIKE the cold and flu are.

716,"Hello fellow students, 

Now the government wants to take away our March Break, flawed thinking in my opinion. Adults are the ones traveling, having parties, ignoring social distancing. Instead of creating legislation that would address this problem, they have decided to take away our March Break. We are not the ones holding super spreader events, not the ones traveling out of province, not the ones responsible for the spread of this virus. 

Instead of giving us our March Break, they have decided to pack us into classrooms where we eat without masks and sometimes can't socially distance. Seems counterproductive.

I don't know about you, but I am in grade 12. We have lost so much this year due to the incompetence of adults. Due to things we have no control over. We have accepted online schooling as a new form of learning, we have taken these changes in stride, but this is not something I will stand for. 

We need this March Break, for studying for IB exams (or doing regular work), to recharge after a difficult few months, to take care of our mental health. Who knows, we might not get any break if the government postpones it to April and things get bad. 

We should not be punished for the mistakes of adults. We should take back our March Break.

717,"For the last 2 months we’ve been preparing to leave Vancouver, we knew it was going to be hard in a pandemic but we never thought it was going to be this hard and it all comes down to the people of Vancouver.

This move was not planned and we’ve had a wonderful 6 years here, we got married here and we thought it was amazing. Every year though, Vancouver has become worse and worse. We lived in West End, near Edmonds Skytrain Station and Brentwood. We’ve seen buzzing Downtown, middle of nowhere Burnaby and we’ve been in the middle of the construction of as many high rises as possible.

When we got here we went walking over Granville daily, then in 2019 one of our wedding guests from overseas got hit in the face unprovoked (we were just crossing Robson) by someone completely fcked in his brain. This city has problems and coming from a European country which has an actual universal healthcare and social welfare system that isn’t completely fcked by insurance bullshit.

No we’ve come to experience the Canadian healthcare system isn’t that great at all. We got in a car accident, initially it seemed okay but 1 day after we had some concerns. We went to our clinic complained about headaches, dizziness, back and shoulder pain and mood swings. We had MSP and benefited but we got turned away because our clinic didn’t deal with ICBC cases. Someone was in pain and needed help but this ICBC legal bullshit makes sure you don’t get the care you need.

We sat on the phone with ICBC at the next clinic for 20 minutes as our claim hadn’t processed yet, but we get all the things. 3 weeks later, show up at the physiotherapist to be send away because they were told to cut us off by ICBC and they can no longer help us. We call ICBC and it turns out it was all a misunderstanding, 2 weeks later everything is fixed but we didn’t feel like going back anymore. The physiotherapist started spamming complaining we didn’t finish the program after sending us away. In the end ICBC send us a shush check for $2K. This is not a healthcare system, this corporate and bureaucratic bullshit.

All of the problems Vancouver is having have been solved before but Vancouver seems to actively try and not work on those problems and in some cases just make them worse.

We wanted to use 2020/2021 the years we would see Canada and then move back to Europe to be closer to our family. We would usually see our family twice a year but obviously covid made that impossible. Sometime last year (before the vaccine) we decided we wouldn’t know when we would see our family or when we could travel around Canada again. With the decline of this city in mind we decided to start packing.

We quickly realized shipping anything would cost at least twice the actual value of what that would actually cost. Not sure if that is a Canadian thing but we thought $2K for a single pallet of stuff in a container was quite expensive. So we decided to sell everything we can ship as a parcel or bring on a plain or anything we don’t have any emotional attachment to.

However, selling our appliances, electronics and furniture has been the worst stress we have had. If you thought Vancouver was immune to r/choosingbeggars, you are dead wrong. People demanding 75% off expensive items in their first sentence. People getting angry and demanding delivery on Free items, I am sorry we don’t own a car either. The amount of single mom students is so damn high, this seems the most common excuse for requiring a 25-50% discount. Communication in English was sometimes rough but the worst is peoples punctuality. The need for 8 appointments with 3 different people for a $40 knife block is absolutely ridicules. Every time you put you post to pending to stop further reaction, you arrange a drop off. You allocate an hour or so, then after being an hour late you send a message to get a sloppy reply a day later.

The worst one we had was someone for some boardgames, that first showed up on an unannounced time when we weren’t at home. Then was late and had to cancel because she just heard her husband had cancer so they couldn’t make it anymore, most of these excuses came either 10 minutes before or a couple hours after said appointment. Then she had to cancel because she had to move to Langley because he dad got Alzheimer’s, the appointment after they got a flat tire on the highway. After that we said we would find someone else to deal with they all of sudden got in an accident (with a flat tire?).

Or the guy that was going to come “somewhere”in the evening for a $160 Tv. At 4pm we ask if he had a time in mind and we got told between 7 and 8. At 8:30 we ask what happened and at 9 we get told he totally forgot about it and that he went to the Gym instead, and that he can come “now”. We replied and at 9:30 still no answer so we told him to fck off and blocked him.

We now gotten rid of 99% of our stuff, a lot of it brought to the thrift store with a car rental, because we thought it would be a shame to throw away but it’s just too much hassle and effort to deal with people on Facebook Marketplace. So you don’t have to so this for us anymore but for the love of god please try to come towards eachother on this a little bit. This really doesn’t have to be such a pain.

Next up, charitable donations. We prepared some boxes for the homeless and the less fortunate. Like we said no car and we would like to avoid contact with anyone. We’re currently at home jobless cleaning our apartment in preparation. We’re offering these boxes, but charities get annoyed we can’t donate more woman’s clothing. Or the fact that we’re dealing with 3 people from 1 organizations that no longer know who’s picking what up and when. Telling us it’s quite a bit of trouble to pick up $200 worth of personal hygiene products, towels, medicine and food. They will get completely triggered we suggested we can get it to someone else or throw it if it’s too much trouble. Well let me tell you, we’ll think twice about doing something nice again if it means relying on someone else if you have an attitude like that.

I do want to do a big shout out to our friends that did understand our situation and offered to help were they can. We tried to give everyone something they liked in return. Also VOKRA, you were amazing to deal with, as was our local Buy Nothing Group (Facebook). It made us very happy seeing our stuff being actually appreciated by people who weren’t impossible to deal with.

We’re also limited by the fact we have to fly soon, and we will need a negative Covid test at a private clinic. Not only will we become homeless when we test positive 2 days before we fly we also just have spend $400 for a covid test with an expire time almost similar to the time of getting the test results. $400! Just to compare, in our home country (Western Europe) the same PCR test for essential AirTravel costs $75 but hey Capitalism and monopolies are great so $400 per person for 2 people it is... thanks Canada for screwing us over at least one more time (as long as the test comes out negative).

Now we respect everyone who likes Vancouver and would want to stay in this city. We did too once but we also have many reasons why we don’t like it here (Housing Market, Housing Quality, Vancouver’s social problems). For us it’s simply not worth it anymore, we’ve made some great memories and friends here and we will miss those dearly. We would have loved to leave on a good note, we were planning on pre-covid but unfortunately Vancouver is going to leave a bit of a sour taste as of now.

I would like to thank everyone for some wonderful and hilarious years on this reddit. I hope you see that: snow/sunset/owl/whale, that you get your bike/tools/phone/laptop back, just keep looking on hastings and I invite you all to come and check out Europe when this shitstorm is over!

718,"Well... I think I need some help... about depression.

I'm an international student and is living in Canada alone. Since the start of this pandemic and the school shut down, it feels like me and my energy is slipping away through my finger tip and it's been worse every day. I feel sad, tired, lack of energy and hopeless all day and such emotion is starting to reach a level which I can no longer bear. I had dreams about I'm diagnosed with cancer which can not be cured and in such dream I'm feeling relaxed and happy. Earlier today my brain is filled with die would make me feel better. Then I realize it's time for me to get some help. I searched and did some auto online drepression test and they all suggest me to get help asap.

I don't really know where should I start with. I haven't dealt with Canada's mental health system before. I've viewed CAMH and some health service's website and they all require a referral. I've also looked into our school's health service and people on this reddit says their waitlist is months long. I don't think I can wait for another month.

Any suggestions... Thank you...",1.0
719,"""How does it feel to lock albertans in who are struggling with depression and fighting for their lives? You're destroying young lives just to save 80 year olds who are already on their way out. More people die in Canada from smoking related reasons than from covid. Where are the smoking bans or fight to end smoking? Covid isn't ruining lives, the government is.""

Is what I'd love to say to Trudeau. I don't believe in anti-mask protests. I believe we should need to protect ourselves and eachother. However there is a line. This year my freedom rights couldn't be more violated. Its really horrible that I have to hear stories about people trying to commit suicide by jumping in front of our trains and more. The government, the people that are at home with a loving family, a nice emergency savings, don't know what its like.

Some people are not able to apply to cerb because they didn't make a certain amount of money last year but they've busted their ass all year trying to work just to get shutdown by covid restrictions all year. Some young people are struggling with depression. There are children being forced to spend 24 hours 7 days a week with their abusive families. How are highschool students or college students supposed to make it out of their abusive homes if they're trapped in that environment trying to study?

Covid restrictions has ruined more lives than it has saved. I know not everything is about me however I'm sure there are many people like me, who have struggled with eating disorders but they're trying to eat, who are trying to go to the gym, who are trying to battle their depression, who are trying to work and turn their lives around but have done nothing all year but wait in their dark room, who have thought of and possibly attempted suicide, who have attempted to work just to be restricted by the government to be thrown back into their rooms.

It's really sad that people are being fined 1000$ for literally going out to socialize with people. Peace/police officers are using restaurants as bait. People are struggling and the government is fearing them to stay inside. People can't go out at their own risk. What ever happened to the true North strong and free?

I'm sure a lot of people will argue thinking this way is selfish, but is it? Why lock the entire country in when we could lock in our grandparents instead. Why doesn't the government invest in isolating those who are high risk rather than giving everyone cerb money?   

Who would've thought the government would ever be able to put a price on freedom.",0.0

YorkU claims they no longer send official transcripts via mail to grad schools and instead they only EMAIL it because they are not in the OFFICE. Okay, as inconvenient as that is, it's fine I guess. Naturally, this change in the method of delivery would raise a lot of questions from students especially cause grad schools don't accept emailed transcripts in normal circumstances. 

The problem is that they are not in the office which means I can't call them so I expect them to freaking answer their emails instead!! I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A SINGLE ANSWER FROM THEM SINCE 7 DAYS AGO.

Hello,

I hope you're doing well and that you are enjoying the summer as much as possible. At the Faculty, we are preparing for the new school year and we look forward to welcoming you virtually in September.

Over the past few weeks, the Undergraduate Studies Office has been receiving several questions related to the delivery of the Faculty of Engineering courses in September as well as the use of the Respondus online monitoring tool. We would like to provide some clarifications that, we hope, will alleviate your concerns.

1. Course Delivery for the Fall and Winter Terms

All courses, including your exams, in the Faculty of Engineering will be offered online this fall (on-campus attendance is not mandatory). For the winter term 2021, we will continue to follow Public Health instructions, and by default, all courses, including labs and tutorials, in the Faculty of Engineering will be offered online, although face-to-face on-campus activities may also become possible (which we all hope will happen).

2. Use of Respondus – remote monitoring tool for online examinations

The University of Ottawa has officially sanctioned Respondus as a remote monitoring tool for online examinations conducted through the Brightspace LMS. However, following a detailed consideration of the software, the Engineering Faculty Executive does not support the use of Respondus or other remote monitoring solutions in examinations.

Professors are at liberty to employ Respondus if they so wish.  However, professors have an obligation to provide a fair and effective alternative assessment approach for students who opt out for any reason. Furthermore, professors who do intend to use remote monitoring must make this clear in their syllabus, and must mention in the syllabus that students have the right to opt out and that an alternative evaluation will be provided for such students.

Please note that this position statement was shared with the Faculty of Engineering professors. Courses offered by other faculties (e.g. MAT, CHM, PHY, HIS, and PHI) may be subject to other recommendations, which apply to the Engineering and Computer Science students taking them.

Finally, for specific information, please consult this Respondus FAQ for Instructors and Students.

We hope that these clarifications will help reduce your concerns and alleviate some of your worries. We are aware that the current situation creates a number of uncertainties and the Office's Undergraduate Team remains available to answer your questions. You can reach us by:

E-mail: bacinfo@engineering.uOttawa.ca

Tél.: 613-562-5918 (option 4 - leave a message and we will follow up with you)

In addition, we will contact you in the coming weeks to share with you the complete programming offer for your arrival or return to the Faculty of Engineering! In the meantime, we encourage you to join the many webinars on topics of interest (residence, wellness and mental health, rights and responsibilities, uOGlobal experience, etc.) which are offered until August 21st.

Enjoy the summer and don't forget to get some rest!

See you soon,

723,"I'm taking a neutral stance on this whole situation because I see the U of A in a no win win situation at the moment. 

I predict that without the CR/NCR policy, the stress and anxiety that arises from school in the midst of a world wide pandemic will be unnecessary. I suspect that because we are in isolate, away from direct social support form our peers, no escape from our lives by going to class, lack of mental facilities that they  could easily access, there will huge mental health risks. Furthermore, the grade. I already witnessed in my midterm avg jumped by 8%, the credit ability of people GPA's are in questions with the online courses when it comes to apply for after grad etc. Its not fair for the past students or even students in the fall. 

In the other hand, I am also a 4th year who spend many hours on campus in libraries studying skipping social life just to maintain my high GPA to apply for my masters. I feel like my hard work merit was stolen from me with this policy and I know I'm not alone based on that rapid petition.",0.0

Dear students,

I hope you are staying well in these challenging times. These last few weeks have been nothing like we could have ever imagined.

I wanted to take this opportunity as we wrap up the spring term to say a personal thank you to you, our students, for your resiliency, patience and understanding as we transitioned away from face-to-face course delivery for the health and safety of our community. We had to manage that transition very rapidly and there was a steep learning curve for all of us at the university. You have been nothing short of outstanding throughout this crisis.

While we are a strong community of learners and educators, the current situation we now find ourselves in has created additional challenges and stresses. I hope you are able to find time for personal wellness and any needed supports. The university remains open to support you in both academic and personal matters online and over the phone. If you are struggling, please reach out—[we are here for you](https://www.uvic.ca/mentalhealth).

We have also established a [COVID-19 Emergency Bursary](https://www.uvic.ca/registrar/safa/bursaries/other) available to all students—domestic or international, undergraduate or graduate—who are experiencing emergency financial need as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We received some good news from Ottawa last week that the federal government is pledging to provide nearly $9 billion in supports for post-secondary students and recent graduates.

For this summer, we moved all of our course offerings online and we are looking forward to welcoming thousands of students to virtual classrooms. It’s a new and exciting challenge for us all.

I know many of you have questions about the fall term, and I want to reassure you that we will be providing you with more information in the near future. Whether our courses are delivered in-person or online, we remain committed to offering high quality academic programming and experiential learning opportunities that will help you achieve your educational goals. Your well-being is and will continue to be front and centre in our decision-making.

This crisis will pass and I look forward to the time when we can welcome our students, staff and faculty back to campus. Until then, I encourage you to maintain your commitment to your education. You are the leaders of tomorrow and your education will not only be critical to your personal success, but to helping to create a strong and healthy future for local and global communities as we emerge from these challenging times.

With best wishes for a safe and healthy summer,

726,"i am currently a high school student (grade ten) and i think its total bs that were still shut down

i totally get elementary schools being shut down so reminder, just high schools

we do everything in a way that it is next to impossible to get covid, we all have our own desks for the week which are sanitized at the end, we have to sanirize going into the school and for every room change, our desks are far apart, we have dispersed dismissal so we dont have crowded hallways, and we obviously wear masks PROPERLY all the time

everytime there is a case at our school, it has ALWAYS been an isolated incident and no one after that has had symptoms or tested positive and they track down everywhere the person with covid went and suggests that everyone in contact with them stays isolated and gets tested

online schooling feels very optional and mine, as long as my peers grades have been dropping. it is extremely hard to learn and stay motivated during online schooling. sitting by a computer for 3 hours straight with a short break and then another 3 hours is horrible and honestly torturous. these hours are during the only current hours of sunlight and i do not see the sun or go on walks during school days because it gets dark so early and it is honestly really not good for my mental health

it is good to have in class because it gives you something to look forward to and to get dressed for and theres not many things we have like that during these times. not me personally, but a very close friend i know lives in an abusive household and school was her only escape. this is the case for many ontario students. 

school os often one of the only times many of us get to interact with other people our age and to take that away is very damaging. me and other people in my grade i know have considered or attempted suicide or are in a very damaged mental state because of the unnecessary social isolation

for those people who do not wish to return to school or do not have these feelings can also choose to learn online so that is not the case in this situation

727,"I am an international student who had 3 part time school semesters for disability/mental health reasons. 

I am concerned that my Post Graduate Work Permit will get refused and put me in jeopardy as I will not be able to stay here. The condition to get a PGWP is to remain full time all semesters throughout my degree.

I never worked illegally, and I have documents from doctors, counselors, and the advisors working with the student disability program in my university to back up this claim. I have found myself in this position because my school recognized me as full time in those semesters (due to disability). But they will not appear as full time semesters in my transcript.

Because there's like a rule ""you can't cancel classes off your semester yourself when you're a first year university student"". So I contacted the staff.

I can't believe I have to ask permission and am not able to manage my own studies semesters). So is working (full time) a good reason?? 

I thought if I said for 'health' reasons it would be enough and they would let me but now they're asking me this medical certification that I dont have!!! I'm screwd.

734,"My friend and her husband wanted this lavish dinner at a specific restaurant for 20-25 guests during covid 19. I warned her based on logic and reasoning that MOST PEOPLE will not show up because of lockdown warnings. I was not insensitive about it, however I confirmed my reservation knowing I would prove her right, it was a very cold day that day. Somehow some establishments within the dynamics of the law were able to bypass the lockdown 4 weeks ago. She was so adamant on it because it was also for her one year wedding anniversary... I do not believe she has a realistic sense on the condition of 2020. It could not be me for this year. I turned 31 and had a very intimate birthday last month, and it did not require 25 people nor did I invite her based on the logic of a covid situation she works in a high exposure environment. Note that folks lol  


She still made the reservations, and it is to my understanding this was not an a la carte (course meal arrangement)....  Rather! People would independently order what they wanted and the bills would be distributed. Now she is contacting everyone who did not arrive to the event demanding $60-70 back to cover her total costs this includes people she is not even close with but were extension invites, and I think that is in poor taste imo. Only 7 people arrived. Note that she chose a restaurant that was very out of distance from many people including myself. Nor did she regard those people with no cars.  Now $60 a la carte tells me this is not a fancy pants place because thats not remotely 5 star lol. However under the following principles:  


1. So lets do the math folks she made this careless decision when i suggested not to (25-7)x60= $1080 &lt; She can make this without effort and pay it.   

2. 2.I cancelled on her TWO days before, because of a priority issue I had to deal with that she knows was a stressful yet brief scenario on that day that involved a family emergency that was unforeseen. However I still bought her a birthday gift and confirmed it with her.
3.  I purchased her a beautiful wool knit sweater to her taste. She is going love it. I spent $50 on sale from the Hudson's Bay. She does not know how much it cost. I also bought her her dinning set last December when she got married. 
4. I transferred some money into my high interest TFSA for the New year.  

5. I have to finish paying off a $2300 tuition fee that will be due by the end of February, because I am an Engineering student. She knows this. I work at a very notable company that pays well. However I am not making the income she makes because I do not work full time. I need time also to study. She is not in college and works overtime hours, therefore her income is triple what I make. Her husband also makes good money and pays most of their bills. I am a bachelorette and pay my own bills. I purchased my pearl necklace I wanted as a gift for me, i made sure to treat myself for turning 31 and looking like Im 21 lol.

735,"I hate my current social situation. And because of covid it’s even more impossible to meet new people and make friends. 

My roommate and I are pretty friendly, but we are never actually friends. Back when school was normal, I usually would meet a few people each semester from my classes, we might not necessarily become close friends but we’d do work together and eat together on campus. So even though I was not super social I wasn’t too lonely. 

With online school and virtual work term, I can no longer develop the class buddy type of friendship with people. Plus I never had any close friends since I started uni. 

Whenever I go out, I would see most of the students are with their group of friends, shopping for grocery together, or just going for a walk. I would instantly get jealous of them as soon as I see them, and start to think about how pathetic I am. Sometimes I feel so hopeless and think I would be alone forever. I think the lack of friendship not only destroyed my mental health but it also worsened my already incompetent social skills and communication skills. 

When I talk to my colleague at work and hey asked what my plans are for the weekend, I sometimes have to make things up in order to not sound too pathetic.

When I started my program I was really happy 20 year old students in my first year and just wanted to study. I quickly came to hate the program around my summer term in 2017, still was left feeling extremely exhausted and bitter.

 I found out a ton of negative towards me that no longer made me feel safe with this program which low key probaly ruined my reputation as worker. Cause I was misunderstood and not coherent enough.  ""Can't  understand that girl."" This was common behavior towards me that effected me in the program.

Group work was out of the questions and had to carry on alone.

 A lot of my struggle happen when I ended up with Sarah Duni, biggest mistake I ever made was letting her mentor this all. She at one point assumed I had depression because I am happy student that had no debt and could afford to go then. That's changed now. 

 I had minor set backs like random classmates laughing not being professional when I was trying to learn or go through a college experience.  None of this could have been reported. 

 A post on the confession page about the ssw program match my own experience wanted to make a note on that. I might not be alone. 

I feel alone in this issues and haven't had much luck trying to make up for any grades and so forth.

The main question is this behavior normal at all in a program like ssw ? It majorily sucks that I have been misunderstood the entire time.

It is extremely frustrating cause I can't change much of how much people let their mouth ran about me. It deeply hurt my feeling everything I went through in the program I just wanted to study.

737,"This program is set up to fail its students. Since Covid-19 started, this program has not been able to adjust itself to fit the “new normal” that we’ve been left with. 

We had our whole program extended due to Mohawk cancelling our classes and placement settings at the beginning of the pandemic. Since reopening the program, a lot of the students have felt like guinea pigs as Mohawk tested how they would continue to run the program with us. 

Flash forward to now, in the last semester of the program right before entering pre-grad, Mohawk has zero care for how it’s students manage. 

Mohawk College made it mandatory for students to come to class on specific dates to receive full grades. How many students do you think came sick and risked the health of others to receive these grades? 

Mohawk College implemented a COVID-19 waiver, making it mandatory for students to sign before placement, possibly to absolve itself of any blame for a student catching COVID-19. Would you feel comfortable signing this waiver? Now think of being placed somewhere with no mention of how the College plans on coordinating care for you or literally any means of support if you WERE to catch COVID-19. 

Mohawk College made students write their comprehensive exam (200 questions in 4 hours) during reading week. Mohawk College would not adjust this no matter how many students begged and pleaded in their emails. This might seem like nothing so I will explain further, this comprehensive exam was placed right after 4 of our major assignments were due. Meaning most of us did not have time to even study for this exam. As passing this exam is a requirement for getting into pre-grad, Mohawk College AGAIN set up its students for failure as they knew students could barely study for this exam. 

Mohawk College is allowing students to rewrite the comprehensive exam during exam week. So study for your exams or study and stress again for your comprehensive exam. 

Mohawk College now placed us in our pre-grad settings. For students that have been practicing their skills on teddy bears for the last year, it would have been wise to place everyone in a hospital setting to implement a wider foundation of knowledge and skills. Mohawk College placed a lot of its students in long term care homes stating that these homes are no longer claiming they have outbreaks. They have yet to inform these students what the procedure is if the home was to declare an outbreak again, what safety measures are in place for students when they catch covid, and what options students have when their family members have compromised immune systems and these placements pose a risk. 

Mohawk College also placed students without any regard for what their 9 choices were and did not care how far of a commute or what distress it may cause the students. Classmates of mine have been placed hours away from where they live with no means of transportation other than the option of taking an Uber, this would set them back about $300-$400 a week for a FREE placement. 

For students that have been placed in long term care, 8 hour shifts are primarily how they run vs. the 12 hour shifts that hospitals require. These hours are worked for FREE with zero regard of how we will make ends meet for two months as working our regular job becomes almost obsolete at 1-2 days a week. 

Not to mention, students currently working at a long term care facility must leave their job to work at their placement. 

If this didn’t come off as stressful enough, any student missing placement hours from the last semester must complete those hours this semester. Imagine being forced to come to placement while sick because you WILL fail the program due to not meeting the required amount of hours.

Placement starts March 1, 2021 and ends April 24, 2021. This gives us exactly 8 weeks to complete the required 280 hours by the CNO. We have a designated preceptor who’s schedule we must follow meaning there’s not much room to adjust shifts. There are also no exceptions to not meeting the required hours other than catching COVID-19. Working 5 shifts a week at 8 hours for those 8 weeks puts you at 320 hours. Meaning that you have flexibility with 5 shifts over two months. 
Most students are missing at least 24 (2 hospital shifts) meaning they have LESS flexibility as they can only budge on two shifts. Now life happens and we are in a pandemic, but we have next to zero flexibility on meeting our hours and Mohawk College does not care when we inform them of this. 

Multiple students have emailed and informed Mohawk College that it will become next to impossible to make ends meet and of the financial burdens that will be placed on them to work in these settings and Mohawk College claims there are no other placements. 

Mohawk College doesn’t care if the nurses of this year end up on the streets trying to complete the program. Mohawk College is setting us up for failure.",0.0
738,"Covid-19 has destabilized our economy and has put the entirety of Canada at risk. Ontario has declared a state of emergency, Alberta following closely, and all but essential services have been shuttered. For Canadian students, new workers, the unemployed, or workers part of the gig economy, many will not qualify for Employment Insurance, facing increasing uncertainty whether they will be able to afford their rent and grocery bill in the time of an outbreak. Workers in the restaurant and consumer goods and sales industry will lose their jobs entirely, causing an unprecedented number of Canadians to rely on government aid. Furthermore, the spread of infection is made all the more difficult to contain, as people relying on their paycheques feel unable to stop coming into work. This forebodes a stormy time for our country, an uneasy spot to be in in our rapidly changing world. Canada needs to focus on Canadian citizens and building strengths from within our communities. Canadians should feel empowered and confident in our Government in such trying times, but our increasingly neoliberal leanings forfeit stability at Canadian citizen’s expense. The economy is stuck in the mud, with current predictions of recovery little more than a guess. Guaranteed income will not only give our economy much-needed boost, but also stave off the growing anxieties of Canadian families facing job insecurity.

&amp;#x200B;

The Ontario Basic Income Project was cancelled by the Progressive Conservative government in March 2019, but preliminary results suggest what many other similar pilot projects have found—when people are given a guaranteed income, their lives improve. The concept behind Basic Income is straightforward, every Canadian citizen is paid a basic income per month by the government. Now, that concept might sound shocking to some, and concerning to others. The most common arguments are that such policies would invite laziness, crime, or lead to a welfare state, producing citizens that have lost the value of hard work. Other worries involve dependency on the government and loss of independence. After reviewing the literature on Basic Income, such concerns appear to have little basis in reality. In fact, studies suggest benefits across a wide demographic. 

There have been many pilot studies in Basic Income, beginning with the 1960’s and 1970’s “Negative Income Tax” studies by economist Gary Burtless. Burtless’s study observed an increase in school attendance in children of families participating in the studies. Manitoba also piloted a similar study, nicknamed “Mincome” from 1978 to 1979. The Mincome pilot found that residents of Dauphin, Manitoba required less hospital visits and medical intervention, noting in particular that mental health greatly improved. The Mincome study also showed that only two groups in the population were discouraged from the workforce by receiving the money—new mothers that decided to take time to raise their children, and teenage boys that remained in school for their senior year of high school where they otherwise would have dropped out to join the workforce. 

&amp;#x200B;

  While guaranteed income is largely considered part of a far-left, socialist agenda, it was Milton Friedman, a pro-capitalism economist and professor at the University of Chicago that was a champion of the universal guaranteed income in 1960. Friedman saw guaranteed income as a necessary for the longevity and stability of a nation’s economy. More families under guaranteed income would have more disposable income, more leisure time, and better health and energy with which to enjoy that time. A greater wealth of businesses benefits when there are more individual consumers. Since Friedman’s time, the wealth gap in North America and around the world has only widened. The reality that there will be losses for many by the way of careers, businesses and the stability believed to be guaranteed is just beginning to set in. What do we, as a nation, do with that uncertainty? We are being told to be patient, we are expected to believe things will work out for the better, but the government could not predict this pandemic. Now that our vulnerabilities have been exposed, we must begin to repair them, and Universal Guaranteed Income for Canadians offers us a lifeline in these difficult times.",0.0
739,"After taking 3 years off of school due to personal issues, I took the leap last year and applied for school. I got into Concordia and was super excited to return to school in the fall, even with the pandemic. 

I love to learn, consider myself to be a good student and I was hoping to engage with my professors. I dedicated the year to completing pre-requisites so I can have the most options available to me while I explore whether I wanted to go into life sciences or business.

On both an academic and administrative level, this school has been a complete failure. The structural issues are on blatant display, and I have never seen such a detached group of professionals in my life. From the provosts to the assistant professors, there is a complete disregard for the students and more generally, the material. After seeing how my peers and I are being treated by professors and how little they even care to teach, I'm so disappointed. My advisor and program coordinator has consistently ignored me since I accepted my letter of admission. The grading scheme for some departments is downright horrific. I find it unacceptable that they are sabotaging students academics along with their mental health. 

The only rational explanation for my experience here is that they only care about keeping students here for a long as possible, and to milk all the money they can get out of us. I know we'll be a number wherever we go, but at this point, I'd rather be ignored at a place like McGill or UdeM where I can come out with a degree that has some sort of clout.

I will be attempting to transfer out of this school, and I feel like all I can do is grind away at a better grade. Seeing as though Concordia seems to be allergic to giving people anything over an 80, I'm hoping this place doesn't destroy my GPA before I get a chance to dip. On a positive note, I want to say that this place has some of the genuine students I've ever met. The student body is wonderful and I really enjoyed my time here, even if we only got to hang out virtually. Cheers to everyone who makes it through.",0.0
740,"I was always a coward for my whole life, well being gay isnt easy at the end. I have never been in love, i always hid myself and distanced myself from people.  
I am first year student in here. In a second year class i took this semester, i met with someone from my country who’s in his third year at rotman. We only talked once but since i met him, i had started feeling things for him. I am so tempted to tell our names and country but i dont wanna leave him in a hard position if he reads this. 
It feels like it kinda grew in me during these past months. I have never felt anything so strong to anyone in my life like this before. I constantly think of him, i cant focus on anything, i keep checking his instagram account looking his photos and even his friends and his fraternity, to see him. I lost all my appetite, i cant sleep and cant enjoy anything. It had become not only overwhelming but also unbearable. 
I always threw everthing i have gone through into my head which caused great depression and damage. So I had gathered all my courage and decided to talk to him in whatever cost. I know its gonna be obvious rejection but i wanted to this for myself, maybe telling him make me feel better. But literally the day after I decided to tell him how i feel, all this virus thing happened and classes are cancelled. Now at the best, i wont be seeing him for months (if we survive the illness). I literally spend all day in robarts with the hope of seeing him but its a ghost town there. 
I dont know if i can do this for whole summer. What should i do? Should i message him? That feels like it would be meaningless without telling to his face. It came to the point where i ask help from strangers in the internet but i desperatly need it.

741,"Hi everyone,

I’m a junior professor at Dalhousie and joined this community about a year ago. I’ve been struck recently by the many honest and thoughtful experiences that students have shared about their experiences, especially about their struggles studying during the pandemic. I have a relatively small following on Twitter but many of the people I interact with on that platform are professors at Dalhousie and other universities across the world. I feel like it would be beneficial to share a link to this sub on Twitter to help give other professors some insight into the student experience during COVID, but also don’t want to intrude on what seems like a really supportive space for students in this tough time. I know that most of my colleagues really want to be sensitive to students’ needs during this time, but we may not always know how to do that and many of us are still finding our sea legs as we shift to a different way of teaching and mentoring. Many professors are also dealing with new pressures in their own lives that have come along with the pandemic. I think that most of the people who would take the time to visit and learn about student experiences would be professors who genuinely want to make this new learning environment as positive as possible, but first wanted to ask for the community’s thoughts/permission. I don’t want to make things even more challenging by removing any of the safety that students feel in sharing their struggles here (or take away from an important source of support), so please do share your honest opinions about how you’d feel about professors visiting to learn more about the student experience if I shared a link to the sub. If sharing a link doesn’t feel right, perhaps I could summarize some of the important things I’ve learned from what you’ve shared here? Let me know what you think!
With gratitude and hopes for health and an easing of the stress of these challenging times for all of you!

742,"I just transferred into my second year here this Fall. I was super excited about starting at a new school but then covid hit.... Anyways, I failed my bus 232 midterm with andrew flostrand. This happened about 2 weeks ago and I still can't get over it. The midterm is worth 15% but since this class is bell curved I'm scared I might fail the class.The average was 56% and i got 45%..... I studied really hard and put in as much effort as i could and i felt ready when it was time to do the exam. Ever since this happened I lost all motivation and because no matter how much time and effort i put i to this class and studying for the exam, I still failed... A midterm worth 15% may not seem a lot to people but since this class is curved, i dont know if Im going pass since my exam mark is below the mean and median. 

The exam was supposed to happen on Oct 15th but Examity had a problem where the exam wouldnt load at all which caused lots of stressed for many students including me. This went on for about around an hour and a half and it was eventually canceled and postponed to the following week on Oct 22nd using Zoom to proctor instead. I spent the extra week going over practice problems. During the exam all students were required to have their webcams and mics on so there were lots of distractions such as barking dogs, trains, and loud family members.

I was also planning on doing coop next summer but i guess that wont happen anymore since i need a minimum 2.75 cgpa. Im taking ECON 260 right now and that prof is like he's on vacation. He doesnt even respond to anyone and Im struggling a bit in that class because we basically teach ourselves. 

I just feel that im so stupid and dumb that even though i studied so hard I still failed... my mental health has taken a hit because of all this and im pretty sure my gpa is going to as well. I know there's no one to blame but myself but Ive kept all this inside and i just felt like I needed a place to let it all out because I have no one to talk to. Im sorry.... Sometimes I even wonder how I even got into SFU in the first place and if I even belong here.

744,"I’m living at home with my mom and younger siblings who are in elementary school. Among the many challenges of this arrangement is that the home environment is not conducive to studying or just following any sort of routine. For example, my mom constantly interrupts me to discuss trivial matters.  Like she will ask will you eat X? Will you eat Y? Will you eat Z? Why does she need to know exactly what I am eating or have eaten? Why does she want to know what I’m planning on eating for all three meals first thing in the morning? I’ve told her numerous times I’ll prepare my own meals. Taking this responsibility should mean that she doesn’t need to know these details at all, since she doesn’t do the cooking or the grocery shopping for me. Instead she needs to interrupt me to ask about it. If I’m in the middle of working on assignments she interrupts me. Sometimes she even interrupted me in the middle of meetings, bursting into my room to ask what I want for dinner even though I already told her I would be fixing myself something to eat when I felt hungry. This caused me to be disengaged during many of my group meetings and I probably seemed like a slacker to group members. She’s inherently disorganized and lacks structure and routine so she doesn’t understand what being a student necessitates. I can never predict when she or my siblings will be out or be at home because she makes plans on the whim or just doesn’t share them with me. As a result, I can’t plan events ahead of time or enjoy private activities. To add, she made me responsible for tutoring and facilitating my siblings learning since they’re doing remote schooling (teachers are a lot less capable of helping students through Zoom). She disregards the demands of my education and she pressures me to be accountable for my siblings’ education. I feel like I’m going crazy. I can’t get shit done, I haven’t been performing well on exams and there’s a likelihood I’ll fail, I’ve gained almost 20 pounds due to binge eating from anxiety. I want to get out but when I do she’ll just guilt trip me, and even now I feel like I haven’t done enough, like I’m the one that’s too weak to adjust to living at home.",0.0

It's critical that we not succumb to fear and anxiety and compromise the education of students who can attend classes.

746,"Ngl I’m getting frustrated. 

The administration decides to give unlimited CR/NCR but not for PoSt or program requirements - pretty sure no one is losing sleep about breadths right now

The administration decides to reassure accessibility students they “will continue to receive accommodations and supports as needed” - like hold up they were thinking of taking those away?! Accessibility students also have had NO communication from accessibility about accommodations so ‘getting in contact’ isn’t really a thing. Really interested how they are going to create a distraction reduced environment in my own home. 

The administration has put all decisions in the hands of profs so students are completely subject to profs’ relative generosity, organization, and technical skills. Keeping in mind that profs somehow have to figure out how to hit mandatory averages. 

The administration suggests overloaded help lines, overbooked heath and wellness, and 911 as mental health strategies. Students who already experience mental illness completely depend on the structure and accessibility accommodations the school provides to even function. Students without a mental illness per se are going to be experiencing increased stress and isolation. Don’t tell me these won’t immensely impact performance.

748," I want to recognize and acknowledge the anger, distress and fear shared by members of the University of Victoria community and throughout the world over the circumstances surrounding the disturbing rise in anti-Asian racism resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the recent killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

As a university, and as individuals, we must continue the necessary work to confront racism, recognizing that many current assumptions, attitudes and habits stand in the way of change. Our role as a place of learning is to ensure that we embody mutual respect, and that we combat systemic racism and all forms of discrimination and intolerance through our research and academic inquiry. The university is a place for students, faculty, and staff to engage thoughtfully about one of the most critical issues of our time. 

We must continue our work together to ensure that our community, both on campus and beyond, is a racism-free, inclusive environment that embraces the many cultures that strengthen our society through their diversity. It is up to all of us to commit to change now and going forward.

The first level of a new [EQHR Anti-Racism Training program](https://www.uvic.ca/equity/education/anti-racism/index.php) will be available online for faculty, staff and students starting July 1. I challenge you to register for the Awareness training prior to the start of fall term and commit to taking all three levels.

Diversity is fundamental to UVic’s excellence and to the wellbeing and strength of our university. We are deeply committed to being an inclusive, supportive and welcoming community. Racism and discrimination have no place here, and we stand in solidarity as students, faculty and staff against racism, intolerance and violence.

UBC will not mandate masks, or vaccinations but will effectively mandate in-person attendance for most students. Do people really not understand why some of us are reluctant? 

I'm happy people who hated online school and had deteriorating mental health will get to go back to in-person classes. I'm glad you have that option now. I just want UBC to give us some options too. You know what also f-cks with mental health? Not being able to vaccinate for legitimate reasons yet forced to attend huge lecture classes. Commuting for hours on busses or trains with no social distancing. Worrying about getting covid and passing it on to vulnerable loved one. Having our concerns ignored or minimized. 

Yes, BC is supposedly on a good trajectory right now. The fall semester might turn out perfectly ok (and I hope it does), but that's based on the assumption that everything is going to go according to plan. Am I worrying too much? Maybe.

I just don't like the whole institution in general and how it gives many an inflated ego to justify the money we spend on going here and the stress + suffering we're put through. I don't like how UTSU puts up an act like they care about students and don't bother answering questions on social media. I don't like how everyone only talks about grades and don't question things in life, and accept things as they are. Not often do I have a real conversation with people who talk about things other than grades, courses or other superficial things in life. I don't like how most of the money doesn't go to the profs and TAs who teach me and how some of them aren't even guaranteed work the next year despite the amazing jobs they do.

I know many will call me a hater but it's just what I've observed and am constantly bothered by. It's nice to live in a protected bubble and I feel like this bubble has somewhat popped since the pandemic and maybe I just haven't met all the amazing students who aren't mainstream and who DO question the system and rules put in place. Maybe I'm just a rebel. Maybe the school system just isn't where I belong. I don't like the fancy terms thrown around. Do people actually understand what they're learning? Can people explain it to a 6 year old? ""If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.""
- Albert Einstein. I just find that many times people become narrow minded too and stop questioning things. 

I hope everyone realizes that money is time and time is money. This school costs a lot of money. Who's time are we taking? Who are we making suffer? Or are we all in debt and enslaved to this system the rich built and continue to oppress? Don't give me the ""we worked hard for it"" bs. Are some people's time worth more than others? Maybe those who have less time. Maybe those who actually do hard jobs, damage their bodies, and put their lives at risk, no? Not some stock trader. Not someone who sits behind the desk.

And if the university cares so much about my health and well-being, why do they expect me to keep stressing over school while I am stuck inside my house with no direct outside contact for the foreseeable future. Do they not see how bad that can be for someone's mental health?!? There are people leaving the city, the province, or even the country right now to get home before things start getting worse, but that final exam in a couple of weeks still matters for some reason. These are unprecedented times and they call for unprecedented measures. Think about the students before making a decision that keeps pissing us all off.

If you are a student at UBCO and have an interest in casually learning a new language, I am implementing a program that pairs you up with another student that wants to learn the language you speak and speaks the language you want to learn! It's a cool opportunity to meet new friends and learn without the stress of being tested on it.

762,"Honestly online school has been the best thing ever for my physical and mental health. I don't have to wake up two hours before class to catch the bus and spend 4 hours of my day commuting. My sleep schedule is amazing. I finally can find time to workout because I exercise in the time I would normally be taking the bus home. I can eat whatever whenever. I can wear comfy clothes. I can learn at my own pace and this has let me get ahead in some classes. I'd much rather prefer to be in the comfort of my home that crammed into those lecture theatres with hundreds of students. I don't really miss coming to campus that much, I remember being so depressed last year and coming to school everyday was dreadful. I feel so much happier and healthier. Do any of you prefer online to in person?",0.0
763,"I am currently at SFU getting my BA and am planning on going for the AP Human Resources Management diploma at BCIT and see everyone saying it's going to be so hard and like nothing, I have ever experienced, but is that really true?  

I do understand that if one's university experience was relatively simple, only taking the courses they wanted and embracing the ""Cs get degrees"" mentality, many other programs can be very difficult compared to that experience. But if you really took the hard courses for your undergraduate degree and did all the extracurricular activities you thought you should (e.g. being a full-time student while also having a part-time job, volunteering weekly for mental health services and research labs), is it really that much harder?",0.0
764,"I think the current state of exam deferrals is laughable to say the least. I can't believe in such a tough semester with all the changes people have to make because of COVID, not only to their academics, but also to their lifestyle/housing situations/ jobs/etc, that the University is still keeping the same exam deferral policy. Now look I get it, you don't want every single student to start deferring exams so they can get extra time but being so uptight about granting deferrals is not the answer.   


How can you justify, for example, a student working insanely hard during the entire semester only to get a cold or fever right before their exam. Even if they had a 100% on all assessments up until that point, there is no way they could write to the best of their ability under those conditions. Sure a fever or cold isn't usually an ""Incapacitating illness,"" not like most people are in the hospital or anything, but it stops you from thinking clearly. Hell for most final exams they are worth anywhere between 30-50% of the grade, if you end the term (sub final) with a 100% (aka 50%/50%) and then mess up the final because guess what you had a NORMAL human illness (that you can't even control...) you could end up losing your grade for that class because the final is worth so much (get a 60% on the final for example and end with a B- or something instead of an A+ that you had before). Or if they request a deferral and get rejected they get an F....  


Its so deplorable that students have to basically make a gamble between should I write this exam given that I'll probably not do very well because of what I am experiencing, or should I apply for a deferral with the possibility of not getting approved and then failing the final. Its even more sad that when people come on this subreddit and consistently have to ask questions like ""I am having a panic attack, with a history of an anxiety disorder, right before my exam- should I write it?"" And the fact that most people will tell them to still write it because the fact of the matter is that the deferral might not be approved (which is true, but sad that it is)? Like what isn't that insane, mid panic attack into writing a final. Who does that even benefit? Hell I don't even care if you make the deferred final extremely hard (idk go from MC-&gt; written) but at least give people a fighting chance?  


The fact is that one person lying to get their exam deferred ISN'T the end of the fucking world okay ualberta admin. The system is also inherently flawed in the sense that you can't request a deferral before the exam date (at least from how I interpreted it). You MUST be incapacitated on the DAY OF your exam-&gt; thus theres no way to even guarantee you get the deferral (or if you won't so you know that you have to write it).  


I've personally had a similar issue where I was not feeling good (to say the LEAST) in the days preceding my final. I was worried it would get worse on the day of, and it fucking did it really did-&gt; to the point where I was cringing every few minutes in pain, but I still wrote the final because guess what its a 50/50 that even in this state where I can't think straight, am having pains every few minutes, I still can't guarantee the uni will accept my deferral. I was prioritizing studying for this final over my own mental and physical health because I simply had no other reasonable choice and that is not okay.  


Also, what is even the ""criteria"" for a deferral? I've seen posts on this subreddit where people state they've had X problem, and even a doctors note saying that they don't have to write the exam (or shouldn't be required to) and still getting rejected? Like holy fuck u of a get over yourself, your exams are not worth someones health (especially when they have a signed medical note).  


Rant over, sorry it was a bit disorganized.",0.0
765,"It's been a few days since I got my GNA and I have been thinking about it for some time. For those of us that didn't cheat and are applying to jobs/coops and they want to see a transcript, they are definitely going ask WTF is this. You basically have to convince every interviewer that you are not a cheater and that you are waiting on a verdict that hasn't come for months.

If you prove your innocence, and that mark turns out to be seriously impacting your GPA, you can't SAT because it's likely past the deadline. The whole reason why we have the SAT system is to help students who are feeling mentally taxed. Without the SAT it could cause someone to lose their scholarship, potential job opportunity, and cause additional stress in their personal lives (which in a pandemic is not great).

It feels like the judge, jury and executioner are all the same person. The time frame given (15 days to your discussion with the Dean) is not at all followed. I'm not unreasonable and know that things are likely backed up. But this leads to an indefinite time period to stress over and overthink everything you did. It's not a fun thing to sit on. I'm not sure if it's a staffing issue and/or a volume issue, but it need to be addressed ASAP. 

Obviously the reason why the school is on alert is because they know some people will cheat when no one is watching. Seeing a GNA in their grades may encourage people to reconsider their decisions (and act as a wake up call). 

All things considered, for students who did not cheat, I'm not sure if the school is taking the time to consider their students well being and future. I'm probably missing a bunch of other things I thought of before but I am too annoyed to put together anything that sounds remotely coherent.",0.0
766,"Is anyone else in the same boat? I just moved here for grad school and I feel like all I do is sit in my room for hours on end doing zoom classes. I haven’t been able to make any friends yet without the aid of social activities like clubs/events or classes. I’ve gone whole days without leaving my house once. I live alone which makes it even worse. 

Lately I’ve been so depressed I haven’t even been able to attend my zoom classes. I honestly feel like the school needs to do more to help new students make social connections because I have to say, I was super excited to get accepted and this has been one of the worse experiences of my life. I support online classes and pandemic safety measures but I’m sure that SOMETHING could be done to help students make friends - I don’t know, outdoor social events or socially distanced club meetings.

771,"I'll preface this by saying that I have an amazing support system of family and friends around me that have really helped me ensure that I haven't fallen into and downwards spirals of depression and sad feelings. The feelings I'm about to describe aren't really about feeling sad and down and depressed but more about feeling stressed and concerned and worried. I understand there is some overlap between them so I'll try be as clear as I can. Also I'm a UTM student for clarification.

Long story short. I'm going into 5th year studying Computer Science and Math. My first two years in CS really did a number on my GPA (as is typical). Dropped courses. Struggled to keep up with peers in the program. Ended up taking things really slowly. By the end of 2nd year, my initial ambitions of masters were honestly seeming like more and more of a fantasy. I did make PoSt however and I proceeded to spend the following two years (3rd and 4th year) working and stressing my ass off to get my GPA to something reasonable. Took a year long break from CS in the process and focused on working on / finishing my other programs. Yaada Yaada the typical trying to turn things around despite how hopeless it is. We've all heard the story a billion times before. Due to the number of courses I had to do, I've taken every single summer up until this point including this current one. All of it was so that I could take whatever tiny GPA boosts were there.

I skipped over many details but by the end, now going into my 5th year, I have 4 CS courses left to complete, one of which I'm doing right now. My GPA is solidly above average now. But I've gotten to the point where a) I stare at work on my screen in front of me and get agitated and b) since CS is not my strong suit compared to math, I'm terrified that lower grades in these last few CS courses are going to nullify all the work and stress that took place in those two years. I've considered just taking a break and stepping away altogether for a while but it's already taking me so long to finish.

I still want to do a masters but my GPA isn't competitive enough yet. It is close however. I can get it there. But most if not all of my boosts have come from math or electives. I'm just so scared that these CS courses that I have to do to finish are going to do too much damage and completely ruin it. I can't afford any more dips, I have to keep it going up. The whole reason why I decided to take 4 summers in a row, to take things slower, to take less courseload, to take over 5 years to finish, to take a break from CS, to focus on what I was enjoying more and what I was good at for a year, was so that I could keep the GPA going up. But even returning to CS now and my experiences in this one course, I just cannot keep that same standard in this subject. It's just way more difficult for me to grasp. I've only just started my 300 level requirements for CS and I haven't done PEY or any experience yet just because every single term since I started 4 years ago I've had to spend taking courses to boost my GPA. And I'm almost there. And I so so worried about this ending and how it's all so fragile. That one CS course that I have to take as a requirement could screw everything up even if I'm trying hard. It's just too difficult for me to get within the allotted timeframe.

It's gotten to the stage where I find myself just sitting for hours when I'm supposed to be doing work just thinking about the numbers and how I'm supposed to pursue a masters while finishing CS. Thinking about how I'm so close yet so far. Thinking about how at this stage there's so many people around me in class that were always one step ahead of me the whole time and have their applications lines up already. Thinking about how I have been able to get relationships with professors that can help me with applications but it all rests on this delicate game that I've lost and then won but I can lose again in if I'm not careful. I get more stressed over how this is going to affect my end result a year down the line rather than what's happening right now. And on the note of the burnout, I have't gotten a break longer than two weeks since I started all the way back in first year. I want to be done. I can be done this year if I take more courses. But at the same time I know myself at this stage and I know that if I don't take it slow it will mess up everything because the heavier courseload will cause me too much stress like it did in 1st and 2nd years and my GPA will plummet again making those 2 years of stress pointless.

I know that none of this thinking is healthy which is why I'm making this post. My reaction to the typical difficulties that people face here has been a lot more focused around stress and anger than it has sadness and depression. On one hand, I'm glad knowing that I haven't had to experience something like being depressed and that I have the bigger picture in mind. On the other hand, my stress levels have gotten so ridiculous the past year that I can barely open up Quercus and not feel agitated just by looking at the logo. All of this because I have to maintain a number. I shouldn't be stressing much over a bloody number but it just keeps happening. I'm so done with most of the grinding and I barely have any experience in case my masters applications don't work out. In my head, I can summarise my journey since beginning here as being good enough to compete but just shy of where I want to be. And I just so sick and tired of constantly being one step behind and feeling like I've finally made it but then realising that I'm not there.

This is getting long so I'll stop there. I was thinking of expressing my feelings in a post here for quite some time and I'm glad I finally have.",0.0

Why can I vote and fuck up an entire country, why can I drink and smoke and fuck up my body if I wanted to but the school doesn't trust students to use the washrooms during a test. Do they really have zero trust in us? If they can't trust us to use the restroom during a test, what's the point of giving us degrees such as engineers? Have they come to the point where they say sure you can now design things and hold peoples lives or money in your hands, but we can't trust you to use the restroom.

If any Carleton staff is reading this, I hope you see that these rules do more harm than good, you've probably caught more cheaters than before but in result have given a difficult, stressful time for every single other student.

Programs like SUB being open 24/7 for students, the food bank, financial support, and showers for students in SUB, mental health support ect. are critical and should always be supported.

This subreddit has helped me through my first year at Mac and now, as a second year student in life sci i feel completely and utterly helpless, so i thought why not turn here to rant about my problems 🤪. My family life is terrible, I’m staying at home and am surrounded by parents who couldn’t give less of a shit about me and my mental health as long as i don’t disappoint and go against them and their wishes for me and my future. I feel like i’ve completely lost all the passion i once had for science and since this pandemic hit, my grades have gotten to the point where i’ve had to withdraw out of 3 of my 5 courses this semester.  Ive never felt more lost and directionless in my life and with the way my transcript looks right now with those 3 Ws, i don’t know how im going to get into any grad program anywhere after/if i graduate. it’s gotten to the point where i’ve considered dropping out but my osap and my parents have prevented me from doing it. sorry for the long ass post, just needed to vent.",0.0

&gt;semester going as planned, when suddenly covid appears.


&gt;”haha don’t worry guys we’ve been planning for this since january”


&gt;cancel classes midnight the day of


&gt;give residence kids a collective three days to move out, that should be enough


&gt;tell my students to keep studying as usual, like the zoomers they are


&gt;ask professors to move away from final exams, but don’t actually do anything about it (haha pranked bro)


&gt;take students grades’ away because fuck following the example of every other university- we’re really _special_ here at the university of alberta ;)


&gt;explanation? nah. We’ll send out a template letter profs can use to indicate your relative performance. _But it’s not a transcript, it just functions the same way a transcript would and is for all intents and purposes a shittier version of a transcript._


&gt;thinktheyboughtitguys.jpg


&gt;two weeks pass


&gt;provide no explanation, bring in students’ union resumé padder/president to come in and ask us vague and flakey questions and not pressure us to fix our bad decision or provide any clarification


&gt;man im so glad the students are prudent in deciding their elected representatives, imagine if they elected someone who challenged me on my bad decision-making


&gt;students are really mad and think this might fuck them over, but also i like my decision sooooo


&gt;revisit CR/NCR decision two weeks later in GFC when everyone’s checked out, just to stress everyone out some more (i care so much for my students’ mental health)


&gt;proceed to then *shut down* debate just to make clear i’m more than just a pos, im an _authoritarian_ pos 😎


&gt;proceed to not clarify anything some more for good measure


&gt;*more time passes*


&gt;it is now finals week


&gt;i know i said profs shouldn’t do finals, but also i really like taking the easy way out so i decide to let them do them anyways. Also haha you should still write them, as I said in my “interview” with the SU :) did i mention i care about students’ mental health and your politicians are totally your advocates?


&gt;still have not mentioned anything about template letters


&gt;have been busy playing animal crossing in bed now that i dont have to give students’ grades anymore


&gt;fuck, this letter thing sounds like a lot of work....


&gt;”Communication up to this point has been a lie/inconsistent, the template letter will just be like one thing which will elaborate upon the CR/NCR system for those needing grades for different programs”


&gt;that should do it


&gt;finals are now over, still haven’t explained template letters


&gt;it’s now the end of april, i can’t just keep procrastinating on this template letter thing, some students might really need this in order to apply to their programs!


&gt;open ms word


&gt;write down two paragraphs providing a useless explanation the students could’ve done themselves (one for each month i had to work on this thing)


&gt;looks pretty useless lol but who cares i get my paycheck anyways


&gt;yawn deeply


&gt;shut down the best library on campus for good measure, and lay off a bunch of good profs just to boost my popularity even more


&gt;also i’m gonna raise their tuition some more- how else will my unemployed students pay for these expensive zoom powerpoint presentations?

Between the stress of having to shift everything online, evolving uncertainty, their children that have to stay home, and just regular life they are also balancing a lot right now.

783,"Just because you're first year and want to look forward to the rest of your university experience, doesn't mean people shouldn't speak out about where UBCO is failing its students. This is especially true when it is failing its students with a lack of resources for health, counseling, and health care.

For instance, the health care plan that students are forced to pay for (Pacific Blue Cross), can arbitrarily choose not to cover any medication they like. I, unfortunately, learned this in the fall when I had to pay $900 out of pocket. It also took them over 4 months to confirm that they wouldn't pay for my medication after applying for a drug exemption request.

My intention isn't to scare people away from UBCO, it's one of the best options for universities in the northwest, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't do better.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, the ""Stepped Care Counselling Model"" shown below, outlines the steps the health and wellness center will take for you. If you read between the lines, they will arrange a counselor to talk to you for 30 minutes, and then will tell you to find help elsewhere. **Unless you are suicidal, they will not offer you counseling.** This is a serious problem. They are severely underfunded, and publish blog posts about mental health and send out daily emails to cover this up.

 

#### STEP ONE

**First counselling visit:** determine needs, priority, and best resources for students to try.

#### STEP TWO

**Campus and personal self-care:** Equip students with a range of community, campus, and online resources.

#### STEP THREE

**Groups and workshops:** Guide students to available support groups and workshops to develop a peer support network.

#### STEP FOUR

**Individual counselling:** Provide appropriate resources to students needing individual counselling.",0.0
784,"Today's decision the University made is certainly controversial, but I think it's important to remember that we're facing something that's completely tearing apart the fabric of daily life. When we look back on our time spent in University ten, twenty, thirty years down the road, this COVID-19 pandemic will very likely come to mind. We're facing an unprecedented situation that one of my professors, who's undoubtedly been through a lot in his lifetime, has repeatedly referred to as ""unlike anything he's ever seen before.""

**I can empathize with all of you who want the option of getting letter grades**. I, too, worked hard this semester and feel disheartened knowing that all of the hard work put in will translate to a mark I could have gotten by slacking off for the past three months. It's understandably upsetting that a ""CR"" will not do justice to the hundreds of hours you've likely worked to ace all those assignments, quizzes, and exams. And, I, too, like many of you, are concerned about how this revised grading scheme will affect future applications for scholarships and further studies.

**At the same time, though, I think it's important that, amidst this chaos and uncertainty, we remember to take care of and be considerate of one another, INCLUDING those we disagree with.** No decision any governing body makes can ever please 100% of a given population; no decision the University makes can ever please all 40,000 members of our community. Whether or not we're onboard with the changes made, we have to trust that all options were carefully weighed before making a final decision. We have to trust that today's decision was made with our best interests at heart, accounting for the potential fallout of cheating on final exams, those of us who may not learn as well online/remotely, are worried senseless about our own health and of loved ones, etc. 

**Let's not forget the 6000+ instructors, deans, advisors, SU, administrators and other UAlberta staff members who have been working around the clock for** **us****.** They've selflessly sacrificed so much of their blood, sweat, and tears, and gone above and beyond the call of duty to ensure we're still able to learn what we needed to, and can move forward in our academic careers. Let's be grateful for the hundreds of emails and dozens of emergency meetings they've attended to address our concerns, the hours they've spent moving learning/assessment online, the care that's gone into ensuring building after building is clean and safe, etc. --- it's all been for the benefit of our student body and our University community.

How is it that we are going through a pandemic and this university has ZERO empathy for any of the students?? I personally haven’t come across any..instead whenever I ask for help it’s “try harder, we were students once and we did it” it’s just so frustrating. 
Can we do something? How can we make the university take our mental health seriously?? How can we make it so people don’t have to think about suicide because they are struggling in school and have to post about it on Reddit because the faculties and profs simply don’t care.

786,"The incident in question occured in spring of 2019, and has deeply bothered me ever since.

When I accepted my offer to York University, I did so believing that I would be entering a space where social justice is paramount and racism, both casual and egregious, would not be tolerated. The TL;DR is I was hella wrong and hella naive.

The professors are not my problem, the students are not my problem, the administrators and mangers of this institution, however, are highly problematic. I found discrimination where I least expected to. I thought working at the alumni fund call center, raising money for the same type of scholarship that helped me through university, would be the perfect job for me, as I care deeply for social justice and equality. 

My African heritage has been the target of employment discrimination more than once in the past. Life has not always been easy, but I maintain and keep moving forward. I try to see the good in this world, despite my experience with Racism. I thought the York U alumni center was a safe space for young black students who want to make a difference while earning money to help alleviate the cost of their education. I was right for the most part. My co-workers were great, even the supervisors. We are all students, most of us share in the same fundemental moral beliefs, and we often enjoyed drinks after work as a group. The pay was even mediocre, which good for a student job.

It wasn't my fellow student co-workers who were the problem. It was the 40-50 year old white woman, who is apparently a call center professional, who was the problem. When I say call center professional, I mean this woman has worked everywhere from Habitat to Humanity to various other universities, doing the same job she does at York. I would love to name shame, but I'm better than that.

The Incident(s)

The woman in question, I'll refer to her as KB for the sake of this story, is my supervisor's boss. KB doesn't spend a lot of time in the student call center, and she isn't even an alumni of the school. Every once in a while, she will come to give us a pep talk, or give my supervisor the business. We had absolutely no reason to interact, as my position of Annual Fund Advisor, is easier 6 or seven ranks of seniority above me. During her pep talk she often does a Q&amp;A, and sometimes singles out a student employee to answer a question and test our knowledge. I've learned to come prepared to be singled out by white woman standing infront of a room grand standing though my experiences with white femal educators in TDSB. I come correct with answers. I don't get to slack without it being noticed. She predictably singled me out, and I was able to impress her with my knowledge, being a new staff member who actually read the training pamphlets. This didn't go unnoticed. 

Two shifts later I was doing some of my first calls without supervision, and though I was unable to get a donation, I scheduled 3 call backs from interested parties. I thought I was doing well, until my supervisor advised me that I was to see KB in an empty conference room, in the attached office for full time annual fund employees, which is often completely empty during a students shift. I thought I was getting fired, as KB has a very abrasive and confrontational vibe. Her vibe was anything but when I entered the conference room, and it really threw me off.

She was sitting at the table with her feet up an an adjacent chair, her face was flush, and her blouse looked as though it was recently adjusted. I sat at the opposite end of the table, and she insisted that I sit closer so she can hear and see me better. I move 3 chairs away, which is exponentially closer than where I was previously sitting. She said she doesn't hear so well, and moved one chair away. She rolled her chair very close, made a point to open her legs, touch my arm, and started talking to me about things unrelated to work. I was very intimidated, because I rely on this job and cannot afford to lose it.   Finding another job would degrade my studies by taking up my study time and causing undue stress. I kept inching back, she would inch forward. Eventually she put her hand on my upper thigh, grazing my glands with her hand, and look me dead ass in my face and says ""so it's true what they say about black guys"". I removed her hand and fled the office. I left work immediately and attempted to lodge a complaint. 

Before I could even finish filing for a grievance, KB had already contacted administration, and told them my contract needed to be nullified, because I acted in a violent and threatening manner towards her during a performance evaluation, and was a danger to other staff members. I only touched her to remove her hand, and I didn't so much as utter damn or anything controversial, I simply defended my sexual boundaries. Not only was I fired, but I was soon informed that I was no longer welcome to study at York.

The labor board and human rights tribunals both told me that I'm wasting my time and there's nothing they can do about it. I'm so angry. I have been violated by this woman, had my goals destroyed, all because this white woman sees my black penis as a commodity, and YorkU is afraid to deal witj this type of thing, so they get rid of the student, because students cannot afford a lawyer, and KB can. This is disgraceful.",0.0

I only touched her to remove her hand, and I didn't so much as utter damn or anything controversial, I simply defended my sexual boundaries. Not only was I fired, but I was soon informed that I was no longer welcome to study at York.

The labor board and the Ontario human rights tribunals both told me that I'm wasting my time and there's nothing they can do about it. I'm so angry. I have been violated by this woman, had my goals destroyed, all because this white woman sees my young black penis as a commodity, and YorkU is afraid to deal with this type of thing, so they get rid of the student, because students cannot afford a lawyer, and KB can.

788,"Hello,

I'm not doing good financially but things could be a lot worse. I recently got a simple divorce, but because the courts are backlogged It won't be processed for 8-12 months. I'm thinking more clearly about my life and what I want to do with it now that she's out of the picture, and I generally feel good about my prospects, but I could use some guidance.

I lived abroad with my ex prior.  We rented, so we had no shared assets.  I'm currently living at home with my parents; it's not ideal but we get along well enough.  I'm living rent-free aside from some small chores here and there so it's not bad for now.  I could do this for another year, and honestly, it's nice catching up and spending time with them after not seeing much of them for the better part of the past decade. From a practical standpoint, I can save close to 70% of my yearly earnings doing this.

I'm 36 and have pretty shitty assets, but no debts either.  Here's a snapshot:

3k in a checking account

6k in a savings account (I'll probably close this and move it to my EQ HISA account)

25k in an EQ HISA account

18k in a TFSA (I still have some room to put more in)

A decent car (2016 Subaru) that I own and should last me at least 5 years with minimal repairs.

My credit rating is between 780-800, which is pretty good given how badly I fucked up my credit rating in my 20's.

The divorce wasn't cheap, but it could have been way, way worse. Since it's a simple divorce and me and my ex have agreed to not touch each other's assets, I owe her nothing once the paperwork clears. As I said earlier, that'll be 8-12 months, so I don't want to buy a property before then lest she tries to make a claim on it.  It's unlikely given she's not even a Canadian citizen/PR, but possible.  

That last bit isn't necessarily a bad thing as it gives me some time to evaluate my current job and decide if I'm going to become a lifer there or not. 

I'm a high school teacher at a tiny private school in the Peel district. My base is 54k and they pay for extracurriculars, so I made around 60k last year. I have been teaching close to 10 years now, so I feel like I'm pretty underpaid for my experience. I took the job as it was a foot in the door; I had very limited Canadian based experience since the process for getting into the public system could take as long as a decade if you don't have in-demand teaching subjects. No pension, but decent if awkward health coverage. Like many businesses, we were denied the usual 3k raise this past year due to lost revenues from the 'rona, but I still have a job and I guess I should be happy about that.  Pretty much all avenues for in school OT are off the table though, so extra money is going to be lean this year unless I start setting up after school tutoring, which I'm not opposed to; I might do some online stuff at home on weekends.

I'm not thrilled with how the school is run, but there might be a role for me there in the long term.  I really want to see how they manage during covid times, but based on how they want us to do things in September, it feels like 3x the work than normal (simultaneous in-person and online teaching yet their modems are potatoes, not mandating masks for all students, unclear protocol about handling student work, it's a ministry visit year so I'll be spending countless hours printing off every piece of paper for documentation) so I'm not thrilled about my work-life balance in the short term, and the money just seems like garbage compared to what I used to make while I was abroad.

I see myself trying to make the move over to a public school board or jump ship to a different private school where the teachers are treated a little better once this school year is up. I have a theory that this will be the year that finally makes most of the boomers still holding on finally walk away from the industry, thus there will be more positions available. I'd like to stay in Southern Ontario and stay close to my parents, but I'm totally OK with leaving the GTA for the right contract, but if I stay in the private sector I'm pretty much anchored to it since there are hardly any private schools outside of the GTA save for Ottawa, and even then my French is so qu'est que fuck that I'd never get anything good there. I suppose Guelph and Waterloo are possibilities too, but I see the majority of jobs advertised (both public and private) being in Peel district these days.

So I'm thinking of changing jobs around the exact time that I'd be buying a house.  Something tells me the bank/mortgage broker wouldn't be pleased with that, even if it were to a higher paying (possibly significantly higher) job.  

On the flip side, management is pretty hands-off and the class sizes are small (2-15) so the usual   
day to day (marking, classroom management) is pretty stress-free and that counts for something.   When it's time to get a new contract in April, I'm going to ask to go up the scale twice and get 60k instead of the projected 57k, which management might be open to. The commute isn't horrendous but it's significant enough that if I were to do private tutoring I'd have to do it close to school then drive home once traffic dissipates.  Eventually, the salary caps at around 81k, which I'd hit around my mid 40's, and while I'll never be rich that isn't horrible. I'd probably bounce in the 9th year just so that I don't go slightly over into a new tax bracket.

If I do stay the course, I'd be looking at a small house in and around Hamilton/Dundas/Stoney Creek/Waterdown/Freelton/Brampton for around 250k-400k. I'd be able to hit the 20% downpayment within the lower end of that price range, but it's just me and the aforementioned assets, and I'm very curious to see what the housing market will look like once the financial realities of The Rona set in.  Odds are good that I won't be able to afford anything nicer than a crack den in the east end of Hamilton since prices will continue to go up up up, but who knows.  It's just me; I don't have to live anywhere impressive, I want something that has upside and somewhere that will appreciate in value over time. 

 I want a back yard so I can take up carpentry and build shitty furniture, so no condos. 

My questions are as follows:

1. Is there anything else I should be doing with the money I have other than maxing out TFSA and letting the rest pool in my EQ HISA for a year?  I haven't really looked at bonds or GICS, are there any out there that will get me a better ROI for such a short term?
2. Is there any reason not to shut down the 6k savings account? The interest rate is a tiny .40%.
3. When the time comes to buy, would the bank hold it against me if I change jobs? If I go somewhere else in 2021, will I basically have to rent for a bit until I have a longer track record with the new place of employment? 
4. If you're reading this and you are a teacher in Ontario, would you advise I bounce?  What AQs or ABQ's should I take over the coming year to help make me more appealing?
5. If you're a teacher in Ontario and you do tutoring on the side, what are some general tips tutoring, either in person or online?  Would I be better off trying to set up my own private sessions, or going through a company? If I go it alone, how would I generate a client base? 

Thanks for any and all advice.",0.0

792,"My boyfriend and I have gotten serious lately and we’re talking  about building a life together. We have very different financial situations. 

I don’t mind since I’m older and have had more time to work on this, but I’d like to see him turn things around and become prosperous one day.  I don’t want to be the major provider long term because I want to become a mom. 

However, his avoidance of his debt is worrying me.

Here’s where we are:

He has 100k in consumer debt (student loans, tax debt and credit cards), no assets, less than 2k in savings and a poor credit score. 

Income is 100k ish.

I have no consumer debt, a house with a substantial amount of equity, modest savings and investments (enough for an emergency fund) and an excellent credit score. 

Income 100k ish. 

The problem is, we’re building a life together but he’s in lukewarm financial shape so it makes it hard to do anything financial together (like buy a house: he won’t be able to afford a downpayment for many years, I could come up with a downpayment in a short time). 

He’s making questionable financial decisions (the kind that got him into debt in the first place) even though I’m trying to guide him in a more productive direction. We’re both currently reading about investments, fire, passive income, etc. he’s fully on board but -

I keep gently suggesting that paying down debt should be a priority. It’s crippling him, closing off his options, stressing him out and sucking up all his income. He agrees and is trying, but I’m not sure he’s being realistic about just how much it’s going to take to wipe out that debt. He’s trying to find a new job right now to increase his income, which is good. 

However, he has big short-term goals: start a business (first time founder) and get masters degree (price tag: 100k). He also wants to get married, start a family and buy a house. 

I try hard not to crush his dreams. I want him to have everything he dreams about in life, but I feel these goals are unrealistic so long as he has  a crippling amount of debt. He’s putting these goals before the thing he should be doing first: getting rid of debt. That’s going to be a long, hard road and I think he’s avoiding just how hard it will be. 

He’s said if he starts a business he’ll make tons more money and that will save him from his debt. He’s said if he has a good business plan he will get big investments. He’s said a masters degree will make him more credible in his field and its needed for him to be taken seriously as a business, even though he already has a quality undergrad degree. He’s said things like it’s possible the Canadian government will cancel student debt one day. 

These things aren’t realistic.

In general, businesses cost a lot of cash before they make you money. No bank is going to give him a business loan when he’s maxed out with debt and has a poor credit score. No private investor will cut him checks as an unproven first-time founder with a poor credit history. A masters degree is a luxury - you need to be able to pay for it. The government cancelling student loans is unlikely and shouldn’t be a plan.

What he actually needs to focus on is painstakingly, one-day-at-a-time, accelerating those debt payments every time he has $5 or $10 to spare. It’s going to be a headache and take a long time, but that’s the reality of having 100k in debt.

This situation is made worse by the fact that I’m in a spot where I’ve been a serial entrepreneur and I’m currently taking a masters degree, which he is emotionally supporting me through. I know some of his inspiration is coming from me, but these are very different situations. I have a poor education (nearly non-existent) and I’m trying to shore that up late in life by getting a masters degree. I started my degree only after I was debt-free and had saved every penny of the tuition. I bootstrapped all of my businesses by being humble and starting small. Most of the investment was my own cash, and only one small business loan and that was won through having excellent personal credit. 

He’s seeing me do these things but he’s missing important details.

794,"With the recent post stating that the winter term will be online, that gives students a lot to think about. This post will talk about ways to stay productive and involved online while also talking about how to help conserve your mental health during these challenging times.

1. When studying online, there are many tips and tricks to stay afloat, but here are mine.

a) Stay organized: its so so so so important to stay organized, in whatever way works for you. I like to use the calendar app and reminder app on my phone, as I always have it on me so it keeps me accountable. I usually have it repeat every hour so that it annoys me enough to do what I have to do. Also use sticky notes, put them everywhere you always go, ur bathroom mirror, ur computer/laptop, wherever you know you will see them. It’s a good reminder

b) Take breaks!! I find that when I’m at home, I can get lost in studying, and find myself wanting a large break and feeling like I deserve it. Then I take a large break and don’t get back to work. I instead start taking a 10-15 minute break every hour to have a snack, go on social media, watch some Netflix etc.

c) try to stay away from distraction. I know it’s hard, you have siblings, parents, loud a/c units, but the less sounds you have, the more you can concentrate on the task at hand, the better you will do

d) Lastly, have fun! Do what you enjoy, treat it like real uni. You like going for drinks every Thursday night? Do that! 

What am I supposed to do for fun? What is there even to do anymore?

A lot! You can still join clubs, the students union had a handy dandy [website](https://www.su.ucalgary.ca/programs-services/students-union-clubs/) for this. You can still volunteer at your local food bank, soup kitchen, or other centres that help others. I’m not sure if the UofC still offers volunteer opportunities. There all kinds of events [here](https://www.ucalgary.ca/student-services/leadership). You can also still hang out with friends, play sports, even if it’s not at the UofC!

I don’t know man, I’m still sad about not getting that first year experience. 
There isn’t a lot going on but there’s still a first year orientation that’s delivered online, click [this](https://www.ucalgary.ca/student-services/orientation/registration) link to register. 

Mental health tips and tricks: To be clear i’m not an expert when it comes to mental health, and this might not help everyone, but I hope it can

1. Do some yoga, work out, go for a light jog: even if it means 15 minutes a day, in the morning or at night, it’s super useful for your physical and mental health, it makes you feel good.

2. Get a notebook/journal and write in it everyday: Write down the good things about your day, the shitty things, and whatever you have been feeling. Sometimes we don’t want to talk to others about what’s going on, and this is the second best thing to talking to someone about it. 

3. Try to get out. This doesn’t mean you have to have friends to hang out with. (cause I usually don’t) Even if  it means going shopping, getting a churro, or seeing a movie, everyone needs variety in their life.

4. Talk to someone. Whether it’s family, friends, or some sort of mental health chat et ice or even the UofC wellness centre [here](https://www.ucalgary.ca/wellness-services) or by emailing sar@ucalgary.ca

I hope you guys enjoy/find this useful, and if you ever need any more tips just pm me !

796,"To all members of the UCalgary community:

As you know, to determine the University of Calgary’s response to the increased number of cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus) locally, nationally and internationally, classes were temporarily suspended on Friday to allow us time to consult with students, faculty, staff, other institutions and the relevant authorities.

As a result of that consultation we have decided that when classes resume on Monday they will not be in-person. Instead, UCalgary will move to alternate forms of course delivery until the COVID-19 situation has stabilized.

Instructors have been preparing for the possibility of moving to remote learning and have prepared lesson plans accordingly. We have invested in new technology platforms and we hope this transition will be relatively seamless. We will also be moving to alternate forms of final assessment. This move will not cause any student to lose credits or the ability to graduate.

We are taking this step out of an abundance of caution. I want to stress that we are aware of no cases of COVID-19 on campus and Alberta Health continues to assess the risk to our community to be low.

By suspending in-person classes – and eliminating the large groupings of people that come with them – we hope to further reduce this low risk and keep our university family safe.

The University of Calgary will remain open, and staff and faculty will be at work. All services remain available; we are here to support you during these difficult times.

I would like to thank the university scholars and staff who have worked directly – and tirelessly – on tackling COVID-19 and improving the global situation. I would also like to thank you all for the measures you take: washing your hands, forgoing handshakes, coughing into your arm, staying home when you are sick and avoiding crowded areas.

These measures may seem small, but they are vitally important. They protect the most vulnerable among us and they are, ultimately, what will allow us to beat back this dangerous disruption.

Even absent from our community, COVID-19 has already had a significant impact on our lives. I want you to know we take these steps today because the safety of both the university and the broader community is of the utmost importance for us.

Students, you will be hearing from your instructors as to how we will proceed on Monday. The most up-to-date information on UCalgary’s COVID-19 response can be found at UCalgary.ca and we will continue to send out regular updates.

We sincerely appreciate your support and patience as we work together in these trying times.

Sincerely,

797,"Ive looked up all over McGill's policies but I cant see anything related to the procedure if there is a citywide/public health or other type of emergency. 

In my opinion, McGill should have released something to students around their plan. Right now it feels like we are in the dark. For example, policy on ""we will implement more leniency with attendance, assignments"" and/or detailing some sort of plan about what will happen for exams/graduation etc. Other universities have said that they will implement online classes/recorded lectures in the case it DOES come to campus. Does McGill have anything like this? 

I think that it would a) let students know that there is a plan besides hand sanitizer stations and ""working groups"" b) prevent students showing symptoms from coming to classes c) mitigate the fear mongering on campus by relieving panic. Ive seen many posts that say McGill is reactive rather than proactive, which is not helping the general anxiety people are feeling. International participant attended events on campus are not being cancelled for example, that is somewhat worrying.

I have completed Masters from US and received one year of work permit where by I just worked for 6 months as I could not find a job instantly after I graduated. So I do not have complete one year of work experience nor I have any previous work experience. I calculated my CRS points which come out to be 430 with no experience which I understand it is ineligible to apply for EE. I also have  good IELTS score i.e. CLB 9

1. Go with student permit in Canada and then later work on PGWP and claim points in EE.

2 . Go to my home country and work for 2-3 years and then apply for PR.

P.S. the former option involves spending more costs on studies as I have already completed masters and I also applied for student permit for canada before 4 months and was refused on the grounds of not leaving canada after studies and financial status. I am worried about reapplying second time.

You have access to telehealthcare with DIALOGUE. Its paid for by the ssuo fees. You can speak with a nurse practicionner or doctor. They also offer counselling. https://www.dialogue.co/en/
I have used this for quick health stuff like refilling prescriptions or minor things like rashes. It is super easy, you fill out the form and video chat with a nurse practitioners on the same day, usually within 10 mins. 
I can’t vouch for their counselling, haven’t tried it. 


You can also speak with a crisis counsellor through EmpowerMe and get three free phone sessions with a psychiatrist. You can fill out a form online, but the easiest is to just dial. You should connect to a human in less than a minute, 24/7. 1-844-741-6389
I spoke with a psychiatrist within a few days of filling out the form, and got to have 3 sessions with her. Awesome. 


There is also Good2Talk for phone counselling if you are a student in ontario 18669255454


If you are under 25, kidshelpphone is good for a free 30 mins phone or text counselling session. Wait time is usually 10 mins. 1-800-866-6868 This one is my fav. 24/7

I am a student, I have used up my healthcare benefits and cannot see a counsellor regularly. However, I call a crisis line about once a month to work through a particular anxiety/question/problem. I think it can be very helpful. You don’t need to call a crisis line only when you are in “crisis” or “suicidal”. I call for many reasons:

•	⁠Making a decision, such as picking a job or dropping a class, talking through pros and cons.
•	⁠I had a bad interaction with someone at work or in my friend group. I feel sad about it, I want to talk or figure out why it affects me so much or how to react next time.
•	⁠I need strategies to manage my time this week, I have too much to do and don’t know where to start.

Just plug your headphones in, pick a quiet spot or go for a walk outside and dial.

Talking to a counsellor can help. Its anonymous, you will probably only have to wait 5-10 mins to speak with someone, its free and it can make you feel a million times better. You just have to dial the phone.
Noone at the university will know, its totally confidential. 

If you haven’t talked to a counsellor before, I think it can be intimidating, but very valuable.
They might ask you for an emergency contact, and they will only break confidentiality if they get a court order, or you tell them you are actively suicidal or homicidal, then they will call 911.",0.0
801,"I know this reddit is filled with a lot of negativity and bad rep about UofT. The truth is that any university is going to be hard at first and may seem super overwhelming. But once you find your footing you have the opportunity of making your years here amazing. Personally, my first year hasn’t been the best but that’s more of a personal problem for me. UofT is located in the best city in Canada and has a transit system (albeit faulty some days) that can connect you to so many different places around the GTA and beyond. 

With its prime location, UofT has so many volunteer and work study positions for future years of your undergrad, along with many on and off campus job postings if you need some money. Most of the UofT faculty wants their classes &amp; students to succeed, although in every university there are a few that do the opposite, but that’s for another post.

It’s obvious that with university life comes larger, stressful course loads, new social settings and sometimes even mental health concerns. UofT still has a lot of work to do with their mental health services and waitlists but with your tuition, you are entitled to coverage for a lot of those services that can also be from off-campus facilities, which allows you to get the help you need in a quicker time. 

I believe that every person will have a different university experience simply due to everyone’s wildly different walks of life. But with that, comes the realization that you can also make your undergraduate career worth it. There are a lot of opportunities via colleges and different faculties to make new social connections, through clubs/intramurals or even events ran by student unions on campus. 

Before starting in September, I was super anxious about residence, new relationships, and a different school schedule. But UofT provides you the support that you need to feel comfortable and able to strive for success at this school. Due to my mental health, I’ve had to drop two courses within the last month or so but the registrar and faculty really helped me understand my options and how I can stay on track for program applications this year. So I get the concerns and worries that could be going through your head especially when reading all of the scary, overwhelming posts on this reddit page.

I will be alone this holiday season as my family is in the US and it doesn't make sense to travel home for the holidays with Covid. I don't have anywhere I could quarantined ne without putting my family at risk.

To say things look bleak is an understatement. My grades are suffering, I have tests due and essays to write and I feel paralyzed.

63,"My FIL has been in Canada for the last 5+ months. We have travel insurance for him for this duration but it covers emergencies only. He is 60+ with preexisting heart condition and diabetes. He is supposed to travel back to India, his home country in early April. But due to the ongoing Corona virus pandemic we are hesitant to move forward with the travel.  We plan to file an extension for his stay in Canada.

If he does get the approval to extend his stay, we need him to go for his regular visits with a doctor to check his preexisting conditions. He is also running short of his medications that he brought with him. We are reaching out to his doctors in India to send his regular medications and prescription document via normal mail but the courier companies state that these may not be delivered on time due to the extended scrutiny at the customs again due to this pandemic. 

\-- I am not sure if there is any insurance plan that I can purchase which will cover routine doctor visits and prescription medications.

\-- Am also not sure whats the best way to get his medication from India for the time being as most of our family and friends are cancelling their existing travel plans.

\-- Or do we just take a risk and have him travel back to India.

According to a proposed system setup by a expert advisory panel, Canadians who return from abroad would be divided into four categories: fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, unvaccinated and exempt.

Fully vaccinated Canadian's would be able to return home without having to  quarantine if they pass a PCR test at the border.

One dose of the vaccine would require a negative test within 72-hours of their departure, a negative PCR test when they return and must quarantine at home until they receive a second negative test.

Unvaccinated travellers would have to quarantine for upto 14 days, on day 7 of quarantine traveller would have to take Covid test and await for results, if test comes back negative they can leave quarantine.

1) How are the people at UofT and in Toronto or Canada in general? How welcoming are we really, in terms of the country and also the school in particular?

2) What was it like switching to a new way of socializing or communicating or just being a human trying to make friends here? Or did you mostly stick to your culture’s ways?

I live in Toronto Canada and found out a friend of mine (23 Male) got his 16 year old sister to cross the border from the states to Canada before covid shut down border crossing.

She is now working at a fast food restaurant under that fake name and goes to school. Her brother is attempting to get guardianship over her. I recently was told by a friend that they know someone who reported them to the IRCC by email about their situation and even gave out their current address in the email.

Here is my situation: I have been taking a certain prescription medicine called **Euthyrox** (for hypothyroidism) for years and I am running low now because I wasn't prepared to stay here for that long. So I am considering the possibility of getting a prescription note from local clinic and purchasing it from a pharmacy here in Montreal.

Since I am new to the Canadian healthcare system, I would like to know more about the cost to visit a walk-in clinic here without any health cover. ***I understand that I have to pay a consultation fee upon arrival at a clinic to talk to a doctor, anybody have any ideas how much it will cost? And does it cost more if I want a prescription note from the doctor?*** of course I will also need to pay at the pharmacy to purchase the medicine.

I am concerned that I will have to do some sorts of testings in order to prove that I have the said medical condition so the doctor can write me a note. I heard that the cost might be huge for people with no health cover. ***are those testings a must for Euthyrox?*** I can provide a picture of a prescription note (non-english) from my doctor in my home country if it helps.

Third year is the tough year to me because I failed one course and had to drop one when i got a bad grade in the midterm. At the same time, i need to maintain the full-time student status as an international student, and I made a fault to keep the credits by committing the academic offence, waiting for the ultimate sanction from the academic tribunal. 

I am not saying I am innocent but I do feel that I cannot always be the person that can perform excellently in the academic realm. That feeling of frustration always makes me feel that i am just a useless person and pure loser in this world. I consistently feel very lonely and I don't have a person that I can really talk to, as my parents do not have a good relationship with me, and my parents cannot understand what I am talking about when I tried to communicate with them. After that, I always got into the mood of depression. Over those years, I did not make friends in the campus and I was always busy with a lot of stuff. 

When i am studying in U of T, the mental health issues become severe and critical problems to me when I always feel very depressed, sad and frustrated and lonely from time to time. When it comes to the fact that I am going to graduate in the future, I don't see myself in a positive place in job market or something when I cannot have a nice GPA or good performance in grades, be more competitive than other u of t peers.

In this case, am I able to reapply for residence after I actually decided to make travel to Edmonton? Also, I got room offer for an unit with roommate request. If I can reapply, then am I able to reserve a original space (with roommate request)?",1.0

199,"I posted this on Piazza but thought I might as well post it here for those of u who arent in the class wondering what its like, and those who dont check piazza:

I am writing this as many people I’ve talked to can relate to a lot of people voicing concerns on Piazza, but felt that some people didn’t expand on their points very eloquently (no offense!) and I would just like to share mine and some peers’ general thoughts on the 137 course so far. Also sorry if my wording-word choice is not great, I am not good at forming out my thoughts in words.
This year is especially hard given we have online learning, which just doesn’t work very well for some people (like me) for various reasons such as understanding things clearly written out (maybe not this type of learner), having ADHD or learning disabilities that make things extra hard, having to work in unideal environments, etc. It is also an unprecedented time and the things that can be done by universities are limited and hard for them to determine the best course of action so I do get this aspect of why people are finding the course hard. However, I do have some concerns/personal feedback on this course.

Even people in upper years now admit that the assessments we are doing this year in 137 are a lot harder than they had (ex. on reddit). There is also an instructor who agrees this year is much harder “I took this course myself years ago and found it challenging to adapt from highschool, so I can't even imagine how much harder this is” https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/jkjeeq/math_137/ A large part of this must be the online learning, but I think that there are a few aspects of the course that are really just making it harder for us than necessary. 

I have heard profs say that this year’s marks for the class are in line with past years. I think that the marks are still in line with past years because a good chunk of people are just doing well because of all the opportunities to cheat in a plethora of ways even if it's just slightly cheating, with assessments being online and unsupervised after all. The instructors must've known this and hence increased the difficulty level of quizzes etc. However, this leaves a number of those who wouldn't want to cheat but are unable to keep up with the difficulty of this course or have difficulty learning in an online format, to see low marks. (Or people who just cannot pass without cheating general). This may actually lead to eventual desperation and cheating, making a big loop back to the beginning issue of cheating (where instructors don’t want this year’s grades to all be super high for unfair reasons). While I understand that most classes in any university like to see this nice bell curve and would like scores in each year to be relatively similar, in the end it is unfair to individual students to have to up the difficulty especially given how hard it is for some people to learn at all on an online format. Now this also causes a lot of anxiety, stress, lack of sleep, and overall strain on mental health especially with the already heavy stress of quarantine for some individuals. 

Talking about specifics, I would like to address the following areas that I take issue with. One thing is the very particular wording on mobius quizzes that needs you to read super thoroughly. This makes it very easy to have silly mistakes made by those who actually understand the material but didn’t read closely enough or have many distractions and couldn’t focus on the wording so much. The wording could be especially confusing to international students who already have a hard time understanding different meanings in English and they seem to have a clear unfair disadvantage. Another thing is how we don’t get any part marks and thus need to know every question extremely well which is even worse coupled with sometimes weird wording. I get that this is a hard one to move around, but for courses such as 135 I feel like it has managed to implement part marks very well (also side note, the fact that we don’t know the number of right answers, as ALL of the questions ask you to choose unlimited choices, adds an additional layer of difficulty). During office hours with a prof, he didn’t even know what the some of the questions were asking and was very confused. I think this fact really reflects the issues with the wording as even a prof couldn’t understand it well. A third thing is how we don’t get to know the correct answers on the mobius which doesn’t help us improve for next time and we have to wait for afterwards when we can check the markbook. But by that time, we would have moved onto concepts taught 2 weeks later, and we could lack the fundamental knowledge from earlier which causes a domino effect of struggling to understand. On a smaller scale, sometimes mobius messes up and marks things incorrectly so not seeing the correct answer causes more confusion and self doubt. Another thing is the fact that a lot of the questions are not explained in videos and we need to make all connections ourselves. Much of the content being actually taught is just the theorems, but how to critically solve questions and what to make of the content is completely up to our own understanding. Also the videos are from several years ago which can be perceived by some as lacking care. 

In response to the idea some people are suggesting about increased attempts on mobius, ex. 5 attempts from now on: I myself did see a mark improvement with the 5 attempts, but I don’t think my actual understanding of information changed much, I just learned what not to choose next time. So, I don’t believe making 5 attempts is a great idea no matter how much I personally would like this, because it doesn’t address the real issue of how many students are struggling to understand the content with the current teaching methods/course structure. I also disagree with people who want to change the overall weighting of the 2 parts of the midterm. I think this would be very unfair as the weights have been set at the beginning of the year and some people actually did well on sections the majority did not. If anything, the difficulty of *future* things could be decreased or we could be given more bonus assignment, etc (I will not speak on my suggestions as the profs know more about what is realistic or actually possible to implement). 

Another thing I won’t address too much as to not spread any rumours based on speculation, is the 225% overacceptance. My personal belief is that the difficulty has also been upped in order to trim down this number, and historically it does make sense. A 225% overaccepted math faculty occurred as they expected many people to defer their acceptance due to covid concerns, but made a big error leading to the overacceptance rate. I cannot speak on any of the 14x courses, but I think that my hypothesis isn’t really applicable for those courses in the first place as those who are less strong with math would choose 13x courses opposed to those who have done the Euclid and proved that they can handle 14x, and by extension, “deserve to at UW”. So 13x courses would be an obvious course to try to use to slim down the population. For example, this course is hard, CS135 is a lot of work, and even 135 started getting a lot harder perhaps because we were all doing really well at the beginning (seen on the mark distributions). This overacceptance rate is certainly frustrating for everyone and must be a very hard issue to deal with for the school, but it is equally frustrating to be given much greater expectations than previous years because of the need to thin down the population. I get this is how universities operate but it is unfair nonetheless that we didn’t contribute to the overacceptance and especially for those who won’t “make the cut” and have to deal with the extra disappointment of failing their requirements (I, for one, would certainly rather not be accepted than come only to waste my time and effort then fail). Again, not saying this is the truth in any way, just my opinion of this year’s difficulty level.

Addressing the midterm specifically because I didn’t see as many people voicing concerns until the midterm: This part is only going to be my personal opinion. I think the mobius parts had the same level of difficulty as normal quizzes, but all mobius quizzes are flawed in my opinion, and the midterm simply really reflected this unfairness. The crowdmark part was certainly harder for me, because of how we didn’t do anything too similar to it before, and it was harder than the crowdmark questions for the past few weeks. Just from my own performance on it.

Finally, I want to say that I do understand this is a very unique time and determining the right way to do anything is extremely difficult especially for profs, I am in no way trying to complain or blame anyone, however I do think this is a struggle for many students that I would like to bring to light with a more thorough explanation. I know that the profs are trying their best in this hard time, and they do care about us. I want to say a big thank you to all the instructors who have to deal with figuring everything out and also monitoring piazza so closely (it’s really awesome, I got a reply at 3am yesterday) and I really appreciate this. Also, there are undoubtedly students who are just able to get very good marks in this course (I will not pretend like everyone is struggling) and I am in no way trying to minimize your effort, good job for those who are doing well! 

Please stay strong and hopeful everyone, I believe in you! And a gentle reminder to please be nice to your fellow students on piazza, we are all trying our best!",1.0
