This is the simple documentation of the data sets folder.

There are three data sets in this folder which are:

  the 988 data set (988validation.csv)
  
  labeled data set (train_df.csv)
  
  subset of the original data set (the one we want to retrieve) (posts-with-International-student-keyword.csv)
